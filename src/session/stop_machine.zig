//! The one place a debugging session decides whether to stop.
//!
//! Run, step one instruction, step over a call, step out of the current
//! function, continue, and halt on request are all the same question asked
//! before each instruction runs: does the session stop here. This file
//! answers it once, so the command layer, the GDB stub and the old one-off
//! flags all step the same way instead of each growing its own.
//!
//! It never touches the engine. Whatever drives the CPU (the Zig core's
//! own loop) hands it an `Event` before
//! each instruction and stops the CPU when it says so. Stopping before the
//! instruction leaves the program counter on it, which is what makes a
//! reported stop address the instruction that has not run yet.
//!
//! Resuming is where steppers usually go wrong. The first instruction after
//! a resume is the one the session stopped on, and it must run: a break on
//! it would stop again without moving, and a single step that counted it
//! would never leave. So the first event after every resume is let through,
//! and only then does the machine start asking.
