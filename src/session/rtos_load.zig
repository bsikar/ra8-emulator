//! CPU load from the RTOS trace's events (RA8EMU-269).
//!
//! Fed the same events src/session/rtos_trace.zig records, in order, this
//! charges the virtual time between two of them to whatever ran in it on
//! that core: the innermost active exception if one is, else the running
//! thread, else idle. Time before a core's first event goes to `before`,
//! because nothing yet says what ran.
//!
//! One exception to "innermost exception first": ThreadX's Cortex-M
//! scheduler waits for work inside PendSV_Handler, looping on WFI in
//! `__tx_ts_wait` in Handler mode after storing 0 to the current-thread
//! pointer (RA8EMU-303). Charged as PendSV, an idle board reads as 99%
//! scheduler. So once an `idle` arrives while PendSV is the innermost
//! exception, that PendSV's time goes to idle until a thread is switched
//! in or the PendSV returns. An exception nested inside the wait (SysTick)
//! still charges itself.
//!
//! Only time inside the window [from, to) is charged, and totals run as the
//! events arrive, so the load does not depend on the trace's 256-event ring
//! and costs fixed memory however long the run goes.
