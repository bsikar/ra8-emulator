//! The session's control plane (time-travel design section 3): one
//! single-threaded transport that fronts the Session's data plane for the
//! GUI, CLI, GDB and RPC alike.
//!
//! `command` validates and queues a job without running a core and hands
//! back a ticket; `pump` drives that job in bounded slices and never sleeps;
//! `report` carries phase, position, progress and epoch; `finish` is the
//! blocking helper a CLI or GDB loop calls with an injected wall and poll.
//! The newest command preempts the running job the way a Cancel would, so a
//! preempted job's ticket goes dead and its waiter gets Cancelled. Pause
//! stops at the gap the current slice ends on, so pause then play is
//! byte-identical to never pausing. A play's speed only changes scheduling:
//! it maps onto the run budget and never touches guest state.
//!
//! Seek and run-to are part of the command language. A seek's target text
//! is parsed at the door, so a malformed one is InvalidArgs, not a silent
//! refusal. With no history bridge bound a seek stays NotReady; with one
//! bound the transport plans it from the committed log's facts and
//! executes it: restore the chosen base's checkpoint object, then run
//! forward until the landing position, reached in the position's own
//! order (round, then phase, offset, gap), never before it within the
//! target's round. A run-to lands where a breakpoint would, which is its
//! own stop-ordering case, and stays NotReady.
