//! `--watch` fed through the debugger's stop machine.

//! src/session/stop_machine.zig owns the watch table the command layer and
//! the GDB stub stop on. `--watch` puts its window in that same table, so
//! the flag and an interactive watch decide what a matching store is the
//! same way.
//!
//! The flag never stops a run. An interactive watch halts on the hit; this
//! one takes the hit as a store to record, clears it, and lets the run go
//! on, so the report keeps every store it always kept.
