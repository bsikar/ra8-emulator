//! Snapshot and restore for a served session (RA8EMU-768): the file
//! `--save-state` writes (src/board/snapshot/run.zig, the two SysTick bases and
//! a stretch section), written from and read back into a live harness.
//!
//! This file encodes and decodes it; the harness opens the file on the
//! serving host (harness_files.zig, RA8EMU-1020).
//!
//! A session's boundary charges whole chunks, so nothing is owed and the
//! stretch section says so; `--load-state` reads the file as its own, and
//! a session restores one `--save-state` wrote. A second core is refused,
//! as the CLI refuses it: its state is not in the file yet.
