//! The persistent history's recorder: the spine that turns a session's
//! boundary landings into event-log frames on the application's storage.
//!
//! Session stays std-only: the recorder never opens a file itself. The
//! application fills a Storage with the three host operations the spine
//! needs (append, flush, truncate) and bridges it to the history's log
//! space (src/host/history). Frames are staged through log.zig's group
//! commit on the caller's clock, and a commit releases the staged bytes
//! to the storage as one append plus one flush, so the storage is never
//! told about a frame in part. Object-before-log durability is the
//! checkpoint's job and arrives with the checkpoint work: this spine
//! records boundary and intervention frames, whose payload lives in the
//! log itself.
//!
//! A reopened segment recovers through log.zig's scan: the whole frames
//! stay, a torn final tail is truncated away through the storage, and a
//! whole frame that fails its length or CRC refuses the reopen.
