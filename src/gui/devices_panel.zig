//! The devices panel's state (RA8EMU-703): each endpoint the run cares

//! session so the event stream records them like the debugger front and

//!
//! The panel never touches a bus. It asks the session, and only a change
//! the session accepted moves a row, so a refused plug leaves the row
//! showing what is really on the line. devices_pane.zig draws it
//! and turns a click into `click`.
