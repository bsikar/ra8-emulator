//! Turning the camera panel's pick into the source the CEU captures from
//! (RA8EMU-500).
//!
//! The panel holds which kind is active; `Args` holds what each kind opens
//! (the picture or clip path the file picker chose, the pipe's
//! `<path|->,<w>x<h>,<format>`, the webcam device). `spec` pairs the two
//! into the same `camera_registry.Spec` `--camera-source` builds, so the GUI
//! and the command line open sources the same way. The webcam only becomes
//! the panel's active kind after its permission dialog was accepted, so the
//! spec it yields carries that consent and the terminal is never asked.
