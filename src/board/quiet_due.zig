//! Whether the board can go to its next queued event without a boundary in
//! between (RA8EMU-185, slice 3).
//!
//! A sleeping core with nothing pending may run straight to the next edge
//! the event queue knows about. The queue covers the timers (AGT, GPT, RTC,
//! the watchdogs). Some blocks still move once per boundary without a queued
//! event: the low-power timer counts boundaries, the microphone fills a
//! window each one, an armed DMA channel moves there, and the USB host,
//! Ethernet switch, NPU, ADC, CAN and IPC models step their work there. While any of them could be
//! working, a wider stretch would change what they do, so the width stays
//! where it was. The display's vsync is timed rather than stepped, so it is
//! an edge (`vsyncDue`) instead of a reason to stay narrow. So is the GPT:
//! it counts by virtual time, but a stretch over several of its wraps would
//! raise one overflow for all of them, so its next wrap, turn or compare
//! match is an edge too (`gptDue`).
//!
//! The answer is deliberately cautious. A block whose model only reports
//! whether firmware has ever used it counts as busy once it has, even when
//! nothing is in flight. That costs speed, never correctness. Narrower
//! per-block in-flight checks can widen it later. Level sources that raise
//! at every boundary (the console's TXI, USBFS_INT) are already pending when
//! the core is asked, so `sleep_pace.still` keeps the width for them.
