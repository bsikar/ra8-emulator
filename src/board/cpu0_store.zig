//! CPU0's memory for a single-core `--cpu zig` run: the Zig core's own
//! store (RA8EMU-580, slice 4d-2 of
//! RA8EMU-481). Board code since RA8EMU-996: the harness and the CLI both put
//! CPU0 on its store through here.
//!
//! The board's blocks attach over the store, CPU0's PPB windows are primed
//! into it, and the image (and any `--ns` half) is loaded into it, in the
//! order the engine path does all three. Since RA8EMU-592 a `--cpu zig` run
//! opens no engine at all: src/interfaces/cli/zig_main.zig attaches with
//! `attachStore` and reads everything back off the store.
//!
//! A run with a second core goes on the store too: CPU1 gets a store of its
//! own that borrows this one's shared SRAM (RA8EMU-588). Since RA8EMU-607
//! there is no engine arm left here: every run is on the store.
