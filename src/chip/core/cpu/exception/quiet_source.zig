//! The interrupt poll's shortcut (RA8EMU-318).
//!
//! `Cpu.run` asks its source what is pending before every instruction, and
//! on the board that answer costs a dozen reads of the NVIC and SCB through
//! the bus. Inside one stretch nothing can change it unless the core itself
//! touches peripheral or system space, takes an exception or returns from
//! one (the SDRAM aperture sits among the peripherals and is neither): the board's clocks and peripherals only move at a stretch boundary.
//! So once the source has answered "nothing pending", that answer stands
//! until one of those happens or the next stretch starts.
//!
//! Give the core `bus()` and `source()` in place of the board's own, and let
//! `Cpu.run` call `stir` as each stretch starts.
