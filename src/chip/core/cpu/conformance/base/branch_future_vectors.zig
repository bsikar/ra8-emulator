//! Conformance vectors for the decode group `branch_future` (RA8EMU-278):
//! BF, BFL, BFCSEL, BFX and BFLX (Armv8.1-M). Expected values are worked
//! from the Arm ARM (DDI0553): a Branch Future only fills LO_BRANCH_INFO, a
//! cache the architecture lets an implementation leave out, and without it
//! every form is a NOP. So a claimed form changes no register and no flag;
//! the fallback branch at the branch point does the branch. A zero boff,
//! hw2[0] clear, hw2[15:12] other than 1100 or 1110, a register form with
//! hw2 other than 0xE001, hw1[11] set and the 16-bit space are unclaimed.
