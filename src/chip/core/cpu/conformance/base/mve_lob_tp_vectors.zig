//! Conformance vectors for the decode group `mve_lob_tp` (RA8EMU-278):
//! DLSTP, WLSTP, LETP and LCTP. Expected values are worked from the Arm ARM
//! (DDI0553) pseudocode. DLSTP sets LR to Rn and LTPSIZE to the element
//! size; WLSTP does the same unless Rn is zero, when it branches forward
//! and leaves both alone. LETP takes one vector of elements
//! (1 << (4 - LTPSIZE)) off LR and branches back while more than that
//! remained, and otherwise falls through with LTPSIZE back to 4. LCTP sets
//! LTPSIZE to 4. The instruction sits at 0x100, so falling through is
//! 0x104. Rn of SP, the plain DLS/WLS/LE encodings, a clear branch bit and
//! the 16-bit space are left unclaimed.
