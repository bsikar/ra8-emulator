//! MENTRYR: the program/erase mode gate, the key that opens it, and the
//! pause bit that halts programming without leaving the mode.
//!
//! Split out of src/chip/periph/mram.zig the way mram_init.zig holds MSUINITR:
//! the block file keeps the sequencer's rules, this one keeps the one
//! register those rules turn on. What it decides is the whole register: an
//! access narrower than the register carries no key, a value whose high half
//! is not 0xAA carries the wrong one, and only a keyed access moves the
//! state. The caller still owns the shadow word and what leaving the mode
//! releases, because those belong to the controller rather than to MENTRYR.
//!
//! THE KEY IS WRITE-ONLY. status() answers the mode bit and the pause bit
//! and never the key, which is what lets the driver's own read-modify-write
//! of MENTRYR work: it reads back what it may legally write again.
