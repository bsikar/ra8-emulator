//! The DMAC channel register window, and what an access of each width names
//! inside it.
//!
//! Split out of `src/chip/periph/dmac.zig`, which owns the transfers, the module
//! gate and the counters. This file owns the map alone: which registers a word
//! holds, which lanes of that word each one occupies, and which lanes are
//! reserved.
//!
//! THE REGISTERS ARE NOT ALL WORDS, AND THREE OF THEM SHARE ONE (HUM Ch 16,
//! ra8_dmac_regs.h):
//!
//!   0x00  DMSAR  32b            source address
//!   0x04  DMDAR  32b            destination address
//!   0x08  DMCRA  32b            the count, reloaded and running
//!   0x0C  DMCRB  16b in byte 0  blocks left
//!   0x10  DMTMD  16b in the low half, DMINT 8b in byte 3
//!   0x14  DMAMD  16b in the low half
//!   0x18  DMOFR  32b            the offset an offset-mode transfer adds
//!   0x1C  DMCNT  8b in byte 0, DMREQ 8b in byte 1, DMSTS 8b in byte 2
//!
//! `dmac.zig` used to switch on the exact byte offset of an access and ignore
//! its width, so only an access that started precisely on a register reached
//! it. Two things followed, both of them wrong on silicon.
//!
//! A NARROW READ ANYWHERE ELSE IN A WORD ANSWERED ZERO. A driver dumping the
//! programmed source address a halfword at a time read DMSAR's top half at
//! +0x02 and got nothing, so its own read-back check failed against registers
//! it had just written correctly.
//!
//! A STORE THAT SPANNED MORE THAN ONE REGISTER REACHED ONLY THE FIRST. The
//! word at +0x1C is the one that matters: a halfword store there carries
//! DMCNT.DTE in the byte it starts at and DMREQ.SWREQ in the byte above, which
//! is how a driver arms a channel and asks for the transfer in one store. The
//! arm landed, the request was dropped on the floor, and the firmware waited
//! on a transfer-end flag for a transfer nobody had asked for.
//!
//! The rule now is the bus's, the same one `src/chip/periph/lanes.zig` already
//! serves the PORT, SCI, ELC and ICU windows: a read is served from the word
//! the access lands in and cut to the lanes it names, a narrow store is merged
//! into that word so the lanes it does not name keep what they had, and a lane
//! no register occupies reads zero and holds nothing.
