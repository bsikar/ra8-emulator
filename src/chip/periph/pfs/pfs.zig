//! The Pin Function Select array, and the write protect standing in front of
//! it.
//!
//! (PFS at 0x4040_0800, R_PMISC at 0x4040_0D00, HUM Ch 20.) Every pin has its
//! own 32-bit PmnPFS holding direction, output level, pull-up, drive strength,
//! IRQ and analog enables, and the peripheral function routed to it. Pins are
//! addressed flat, (port * 16) + pin, four bytes each, fifteen ports of
//! sixteen.
//!
//! WHAT THIS BLOCK IS FOR is not the fields, which nothing here reads yet: it
//! is the gate. A PmnPFS write only lands while PWPRS.PFSWE stands, and
//! skipping the unlock does not fault and does not report. The write silently
//! goes nowhere and the driver carries on believing the pin is routed, which
//! is the single worst way for a pin bring-up bug to present. See
//! `pfs_protect.zig` for the two-step sequence and for why the Secure path is
//! the one that gates.
//!
//! Before this block existed the whole window fell to the bus catch-all, which
//! stores whatever it is handed and reads it back, so every pin write landed
//! whether or not the firmware had unlocked.
//!
//! THE ONE ORDERING RULE PmnPFS HAS lives in `pfs_route.zig`: a pin is meant
//! to be returned to GPIO mode before a new peripheral function is programmed
//! onto it, and a store that moves a routed pin straight to a different
//! function leaves the pad driving the old one while the new select decodes.
//! That store is taken here exactly as the part takes it, and counted, because
//! the glitch is invisible from the firmware side.
//!
//! THE REST OF PMISC IS A SHADOW and deliberately so. PFENET and PMSAR are in
//! the same window, nothing in the corpus touches either, and PMSAR in
//! particular would change which of the two write-protect paths owns a port.
//! Modelling it on no evidence would be guessing at the thing the gate turns
//! on, so it stores and reads back and nothing more.
