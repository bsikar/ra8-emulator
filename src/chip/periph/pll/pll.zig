//! The PLL configuration registers, PLL1's and PLL2's, plus MOSCWTCR, behind
//! PRCR.PRC0, with the divider code the hardware silently rejects.
//!
//! PLL1's three were the next most-written unmodelled addresses in the EIL
//! corpus after the low-power bytes: 26 of the 36 images write all three,
//! always the same values. They come from ra8_cgc.c's clock bring-up:
//! internal_start_main_osc writes MOSCWTCR = 9 before releasing the main
//! oscillator, and internal_program_and_start_pll1 writes PLLCCR = 0xFA02
//! and PLLCCR2 = 0x451, the EK-RA8D2 quickstart numbers (XTAL 24 MHz, /3 in,
//! x250.00, P=/2, Q=/6, R=/5), between stopping and restarting PLL1.
//!
//! PLL2 IS THE USB CLOCK'S PLL and was entirely unmodelled until this file
//! grew to hold it: both its registers fell to the SYSC catch-all, which
//! stores whatever it is handed and reads it back, so every rule below was
//! missing for the one PLL whose driver path is the most careful about them.
//! ra8_cgc_usb.c's internal_pll2_program_protected stops PLL2, waits for
//! OSCSF.PLL2SF to clear, writes PLL2CCR then PLL2CCR2, and restarts it, all
//! inside RA8_PROTECTED_WRITE(unlock_cgc), and ra8_cgc_pll2_enable computes
//! Q and R as /6 purely so no field carries the prohibited code, saying so in
//! its own comment: "Code 0 is prohibited per HUM Ch 9.2.10/9.2.12 (drops the
//! whole 16-bit write)."
//!
//!   PLLCCR2  (0x4001_E04C, 16b)  PLODIVP[3:0] PLODIVQ[7:4] PLODIVR[11:8]
//!   PLL2CCR2 (0x4001_E04E, 16b)  the same three fields
//!   MOSCWTCR (0x4001_E0A2,  8b)  main oscillator wait cycles
//!   PLLCCR   (0x4001_E0AC, 32b)  PLIDIV[1:0] PLSRCSEL[4] PLLMULNF[7:6]
//!                                PLLMUL[16:8]
//!   PLL2CCR  (0x4001_E0C8, 32b)  the same four fields
//!
//! Offsets and field layouts are from libs/ra8_hal/inc/ra8_system_regs.h and
//! ra8_cgc_regs.h on zig/dev, which cite HUM Ch 9.2.6 p 331 (PLLCCR),
//! Ch 9.2.7 p 332 (PLLCCR2), Ch 9.2.10 p 335 (PLL2CCR), Ch 9.2.12 p 335
//! (PLL2CCR2) and Ch 9.2.27 p 349 (MOSCWTCR) alongside the FSP CMSIS header
//! and bsp_clocks.c. PLL2CR, the stop control, is not here: oscsf.zig already
//! owns it and the run state it drives.
//!
//! Three rules make these worth modelling rather than storing, and all three
//! apply to both PLLs.
//!
//! PRC0, the same gate sysclk.zig takes: these are CGC registers, and both
//! drivers only reach them inside RA8_PROTECTED_WRITE(unlock_cgc). A store
//! arriving with PRC0 clear is discarded by silicon with no fault and no flag.
//!
//! THE PROHIBITED DIVIDER, which belongs to the CCR2 of either PLL: the bit
//! pattern 0000 in any of PLODIVP, PLODIVQ or PLODIVR is "Setting prohibited"
//! per HUM Ch 9.2.7 and Ch 9.2.10/9.2.12, and ra8_cgc_regs.h records what the
//! hardware does with it in so many words: the entire 16-bit register write is
//! dropped and the register keeps its previous value. That is why
//! k_ra8_plodiv_div1 is absent from the firmware enum. A model that stored the
//! word anyway would let firmware configure a PLL output ratio here that
//! silicon never accepted, and the run would report a clock tree the bench
//! does not have. The rule lives in `pll_config.zig` now that two PLLs need
//! it.
//!
//! AND THE STOP BARRIER, which this file previously wrote off as a driver
//! contract and which the tree says outright is the hardware's. ra8_cgc.c's
//! own file header, step 3: "Stop PLL1 (PLLCR = 1), then poll OSCSF.PLLSF = 0.
//! Without this barrier, PLLCCR / PLLCCR2 writes are silently dropped and read
//! back as zero." That is not a precondition the driver keeps out of tidiness,
//! it is what silicon does, and internal_cgc_init_protected orders
//! internal_stop_pll1 before internal_program_and_start_pll1 for exactly that
//! reason. PLL2 has the same barrier on its own flag, cited at HUM Ch 9.2.11
//! p 336 in internal_pll2_program_protected, and ra8_cgc_pll2_enable leans on
//! it the other way round: finding PLL2SF already set, it returns early
//! WITHOUT reprogramming, because a live PLL2 would take nothing and the USB
//! clock hanging off PLL2P would lose its source. So a configuration store
//! arriving while that PLL's OSCSF flag is set is dropped and counted, and a
//! later read gives back what was there before, which before any successful
//! store is zero, the way the driver's note says.
//!
//! EACH PLL CARRIES ITS OWN BARRIER FLAG, as data on the slot rather than a
//! special case in the store path: PLL1's registers watch OSCSF.PLL1SF, PLL2's
//! watch PLL2SF, and MOSCWTCR watches nothing.
//!
//! MOSCWTCR IS OUTSIDE THE BARRIER and deliberately so: it is the main
//! oscillator's wait count, written in step 1 by internal_start_main_osc,
//! before PLL1 is stopped at all, and nothing in the tree ties it to either
//! PLL's run state.
//!
//! DELIBERATELY NOT MODELLED. The reset values: nothing in the tree records
//! them, so the registers start at zero here and the report only speaks once
//! firmware has written. No frequency is derived: the multipliers and the
//! ratios are reported as written, because turning them into megahertz would
//! need the XTAL rate, which this emulator does not model. Nothing derives
//! USBCLK from PLL2P either, for the same reason. Nor does anything here check
//! the core voltage range VSCR selected: step 2 is a brown-out hazard rather
//! than a rule the clock registers enforce, so it belongs to whatever models
//! the consequence, not to this file.
