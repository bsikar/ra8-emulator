//! CFDRFCCa, the RX FIFO's own configuration register, and the two rules
//! that decide whether the FIFO is there to receive anything at all.
//!
//! The FIFO does not power up ready. CFDRFCCa.RFE brings it out of the
//! disabled state, and until that bit stands a frame the acceptance filter
//! took has nowhere to go: the controller drops it rather than queueing it.
//! ra8_canfd.c does this in two deliberate steps and says why in its own
//! doc comments, citing HUM Ch 41 "CFDRFCCa" pp 2741-2742:
//!
//!   internal_configure_rx_fifo0  RFDC and RFPLS, written in GL_RESET
//!   internal_enable_rx_fifo0     RFE alone, written in GL_OPERATION
//!
//! It splits them because RFE DOES NOT TAKE IN GL_RESET ("Setting RFE here
//! would silently no-op, the FIFO would stay disabled, and every loopback
//! frame would land in /dev/null instead of the RX FIFO"), and because RFE
//! does not take while RFDC is zero either ("This bit can only be set if
//! the configured FIFO depth is greater than 0x000"). Both are refusals of
//! the SET only: clearing RFE is allowed from anywhere.
//!
//!   CFDRFCC[0]  +0x03C   (ra8_canfd_regs.h: offset 0x03C..0x043, two FIFOs)
//!     RFE   [0]    enable the FIFO
//!     RFIE  [1]    raise the receive interrupt
//!     RFDC  [10:8] how many frames it holds
//!
//! RFDC IS READ ONLY AS ZERO OR NON-ZERO, deliberately. The one encoding
//! this tree documents is ra8_canfd.c's `k_rfcc_rfdc_4msgs = 1UL << 8U`,
//! four entries; nothing here gives the rest of the field, so the depth
//! stays src/chip/periph/canfd_fifo.zig's stated four rather than a guessed
//! decode of a field we have one point of.
