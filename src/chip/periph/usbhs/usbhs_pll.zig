//! The USB high-speed PHY's own PLL: the two registers that bring the
//! analog block up, and the lock flag the driver spins on before it will
//! touch anything else.
//!
//! This is not the module's power switch, which is SYSCFG and lives in
//! usbhs_phy.zig. It is the PHY behind it: PHYSET holds the analog
//! power-down and the PLL reset, LPSTS gates the PHY clock, and PLLSTA
//! reports whether the UTMI PLL has settled. The order matters, and it is
//! the driver's, not this model's: ra8_usb_phy.c's internal_usbhs_try_clksel
//! drops SUSPENDM, asserts DIRPD and PLLRESET together with a CLKSEL
//! codepoint, releases DIRPD, waits a millisecond, releases PLLRESET, sets
//! SUSPENDM, and only then polls PLLSTA.
//!
//! Two things follow that this model has to honour. The lock cannot depend
//! on SYSCFG.USBE, because HUM Figure 37.2 (p 2121, quoted in that driver)
//! puts USBE *after* the lock is observed: a model that waits for USBE waits
//! for something the driver will not do until the model answers. And it
//! cannot be free either, or the whole sequence above is ceremony: a run
//! that never powers the analog block gets a locked PLL and reports a PHY
//! that came up when on the bench it never would have.
