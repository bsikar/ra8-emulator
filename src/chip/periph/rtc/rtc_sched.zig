//! When the RTC next needs a boundary on the virtual time base (RA8EMU-182,

//!
//! A virtual-time RTC owes its seconds at whole-second edges of the virtual
//! nanoseconds it has run. The alarm compare and the periodic event are both
//! evaluated when a second lands, so the clock queues the next second edge
//! whenever either is enabled, and the boundary that closes on it evaluates
//! the alarm at the virtual time it matched. Queuing the edge rather than
//! working out how many seconds away the match is keeps this one division
//! per boundary; a far alarm costs one event a second, which idle
//! fast-forward (RA8EMU-185) skips through. A geared clock and a stopped one
//! queue nothing, which is what keeps the corpus unchanged.
