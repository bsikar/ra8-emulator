//! The temperature sensor's factory calibration words, as memory.
//!
//! HUM Ch 55.2.2 p 3498-3499 puts TSCDR and TSCDR2 in the MRAM trim area at
//! 0x02C1_EDA0: TSCDR is the ADC code the die read at the high reference
//! (125 degC on the EK-RA8D2's part) and TSCDR2 the code at -40 degC. Only
//! the low 12 bits carry the code. The firmware's TSN driver reads both
//! with ordinary loads and converts a live sample with a two-point line.
//!
//! Nothing mapped that page, so adc_diag_tsn_demo stopped in
//! ra8_tsn_convert_to_milli_c on an unmapped read of 0x02C1_EDA0.
//!
//! The words seeded here pair with adc_scan.temperature_code (1800): the
//! firmware's integer maths turns that code into 26.000 degC, the same
//! plausible deterministic die the ADC model already promised. A page an
//! image already mapped keeps its bytes, the way mram_window.zig does.
