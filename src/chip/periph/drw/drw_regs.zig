//! The DRW register map: where each register this model tracks sits in the
//! window, and the field layout read out of one of them.
//!
//! The map lives next to the block rather than inside it, the same way
//! `ulpt_regs.zig` and `eth_regs.zig` sit beside theirs: `drw.zig` carries
//! the meaning (what a write does, what a read answers), and the offsets are
//! a table anyone comparing against the HUM should be able to read on their
//! own.
//!
//! Every DRW register is 32 bits wide (HUM Ch 62.2), so an access narrower
//! than a word names lanes of ONE register, which is the `lanes.zig` shape,
//! not the `bytelanes.zig` shape the RIIC, DTC and ULPT windows need.
