//! MRMAC0/MRMAC1: the address the RMAC matches a frame against, and the port
//! mode a store has to land in to reach it.
//!
//! The perfect-match address is two words of the RMAC window: MRMAC0 (+0x84)
//! carries the top two octets in its MAU field and MRMAC1 (+0x88) the bottom
//! four, which is the layout `ra8_rmac_set_mac_address` builds
//! (ra8_rmac.c:582, citing HUM Ch 33.4 "MRMAC0/MRMAC1 : MAC Reception MAC
//! Address Configuration Registers" p 1707, with the per-register pages at
//! p 1716 and p 1717).
//!
//! THE PAIR IS NOT PLAIN STORAGE. It sits behind the same gate as MPIC: a
//! store only sticks while the ETHA port paired with this RMAC is in CONFIG,
//! and a store made while the port is running is swallowed. `ra8_eth.c:441`
//! says so from the bench rather than from the manual: "without the DISABLE
//! -> CONFIG -> {MAC write} -> DISABLE -> OPERATION bracket, MRMAC0 / MRMAC1
//! read back as 0 after ra8_eth_open completes, and every wire-side ARP
//! who-has gets dropped at the RMAC perfect-match comparator before the GWCA
//! descriptor ring ever sees it". That is the failure this model could not
//! reproduce: the two words were not claimed by any block, so the bus kept
//! whatever was written to them at any mode, and a driver that programmed its
//! address with the port already operational read the address back here and
//! answered nothing on the wire. The store is refused and counted now, the
//! same cut the gateway's ring-base registers already take against a GWCA in
//! CONFIG.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the comparator itself. Nothing in this tree
//! receives a frame addressed to the port, so the address is carried and
//! reported, never matched against anything. The bits above MAU are left as
//! written rather than read back as zero: ra8_rmac_regs.h names the field's
//! extent, not what silicon does with the rest of the word.
