//! The register map of the ELC window, and what an access of each width names
//! inside it.
//!
//! Split out of `src/chip/periph/elc.zig`, which owns the generators, the link
//! table and the counters. This file owns the map alone: which register a word
//! holds, which lanes of that word the register actually occupies, and which
//! lanes are reserved.
//!
//! THE REGISTERS ARE NOT ALL WORDS, AND THE WINDOW IS MOSTLY RESERVED SPACE
//! (HUM Ch 19 p 817..836, ra8_elc_regs.h):
//!
//!   0x000  ELCR     8b in byte 0        the global enable, ELCON b7
//!   0x004  ELSEGRn  8b in byte 0        software event generators, stride 4
//!   0x020  ELSR[n]  16b in the low half the source event a slot takes, stride 4
//!   0x100  ELCSARx  32b                 security attribution, stored only
//!   0x110  ELCPARx  32b                 privilege attribution, stored only
//!
//! ELSR IS SIXTEEN BITS AND ELS IS TEN OF THEM, SO THE HIGH BITS OF AN EVENT
//! NUMBER LIVE IN THE SECOND BYTE. `elc.zig` used to switch on the raw byte
//! offset of an access and ignore its width, and the offset it switched on was
//! the whole stride, so every byte of a slot's word was the slot: a store of
//! the high byte at ELSR+1, the way a driver spells `ELS |= 0x100` when it
//! only has the top bits to set, landed as the LOW byte instead. Event 0x120
//! linked that way became event 0x001, a read-back of the same byte answered
//! the low byte and agreed, and the run reported a programmed link that took
//! the wrong event and never conducted the right one.
//!
//! THE SAME SLOPPINESS RAN THE OTHER WAY ON THE GENERATORS. ELSEGRn is one
//! byte, and the three bytes above it are reserved, but each of them decoded
//! to the generator: a stray byte store at +0x006 ran the trigger sequence and
//! could raise a software event silicon would never have raised. A store that
//! names only reserved lanes is nothing here now, not a trigger and not a
//! refusal, because that is what it is on the part.
