//! The peripheral clock source selects and the SREQ -> SRDY handshake.
//!
//! Seven 8-bit registers scattered through the SYSC window pick the source
//! clock for a peripheral that runs off its own branch rather than off PCLK:
//!
//!   SCICKCR    (+0x055)  SCI_B TCLK             (HUM Ch 9.2.54 p 368)
//!   USBCKCR    (+0x074)  USB-FS module clock
//!   OCTACKCR   (+0x075)  Octal-SPI clock        (HUM Ch 9.2.45 p 360)
//!   CANFDCKCR  (+0x076)  CAN-FD core clock      (HUM Ch 9.2.46 p 366)
//!   USB60CKCR  (+0x077)  USBHS 60 MHz clock
//!   ESWCKCR    (+0x0DB)  Ethernet-switch core clock
//!   ESWPCKCR   (+0x0DC)  Ethernet-PHY interface clock
//!
//! They share one layout, and the firmware says so in three separate places:
//! ra8_xspi.c and ra8_canfd.c both reach for `k_ra8_usbckcr_bit_sreq` and
//! `k_ra8_usbckcr_bit_srdy` rather than defining their own; ra8_system_regs.h
//! says of ESWPCKCR "layout identical to ESWCKCR" and of ESWCKCR "layout
//! identical to USB60CKCR"; and ra8_cgc_eswclk.c's own step 1 comment reads
//! "ESWCKCR / ESWPCKCR / USBCKCR / USB60CKCR all share the same" handshake.
//! SEL is bits 3:0, SREQ is bit 6, and SRDY is bit 7 and is read only.
//!
//! A SOURCE IS NOT SWITCHED BY WRITING SEL. HUM Ch 9 "Clock Selection
//! Switching Procedure" makes it a handshake, and ra8_cgc.h writes the steps
//! out: assert SREQ, WAIT FOR SRDY TO READ 1 (the branch is now gated and
//! therefore switchable), write the divider, write SEL with SREQ still set,
//! drop SREQ, then WAIT FOR SRDY TO READ 0 (the new source is running). Both
//! waits are bounded spins, and every caller gives them a budget and then
//! gives up: 200,000 iterations in ra8_cgc_usb.c and ra8_cgc_eswclk.c,
//! 0x40000 in ra8_cgc.c's internal_route_sciclk, each returning
//! k_ra8_err_hw_timeout when they run out.
//!
//! Nothing modelled these registers, so they fell through to the sparse
//! register file, which answers the last word written. SRDY is bit 7 and no
//! driver ever writes it, so it read 0 forever: the first wait, for SRDY = 1,
//! spun out its whole budget and every one of these paths returned a hardware
//! timeout before it reached the second wait. ra8_cgc_usbfs_clock_enable,
//! ra8_cgc_usbhs_clock_enable, the XSPI clock bring-up in ra8_xspi.c, the
//! CAN-FD one in ra8_canfd.c, internal_route_sciclk and
//! internal_switch_eswcr_to_pll1p all failed the same way and for the same
//! reason.
//!
//! SRDY simply follows SREQ here: the branch gates and ungates in no time, so
//! a driver polling for 1 and then for 0 makes progress on both, and a driver
//! that reads SRDY without having asked for anything still reads 0.
//!
//! THE THREE WINDOWS ARE THREE WINDOWS, not one span with holes in it. The
//! registers between them belong to other blocks and to the sparse file, and
//! claiming 0x055 through 0x0DC wholesale would swallow SCICKDIVCR,
//! ESWCKDIVCR and everything else in between. Each run of adjacent selects
//! gets its own bus entry and they share one model.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the module-stop precondition. HUM Ch 9
//! requires the dependent peripheral to be in module-stop before SREQ is
//! asserted when the divider is changing, and ra8_cgc_usb.c says in so many
//! words that "if the caller has already released MSTPB12 (USBHS) the
//! SREQ->SRDY handshake silently hangs". Honouring that needs the module-stop
//! bit for each of these branches, and src/chip/periph/mstp.zig carries no family
//! for either USB controller, so a hang modelled here would be a guess for
//! half the window. Nor is the ESWM power domain asked: ra8_cgc_eswclk.c
//! drops PDCTRESWM.PDDE before it switches, and src/chip/periph/pdctr.zig models
//! the GRAPHICS domain only, so the ESWM one has no model to ask. No clock
//! RATE is derived from SEL either: the value is retained and reported,
//! nothing downstream reads it, and the dividers at +0x054, +0x06C, +0x06F
//! and +0x0D5 are not these registers.
