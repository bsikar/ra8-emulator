//! The feature-map registers a Vela program sets with cmd0 commands: the
//! shape, precision, zero point and region of the input (IFM), the second
//! input (IFM2) and the output (OFM).
//!
//! The operators need these to know what they are reading and writing; the
//! bases come from npu_vela_regs.zig. Values are kept raw, as the 16-bit
//! parameter each command carries; the _m1 fields are the size minus one,
//! and the shape helpers add the one back. Opcodes from Arm's Vela 3.12.0
//! (Apache-2.0) ethos_u55_regs.py `cmd0`. Any other cmd0 set is reported
//! as not modelled.
