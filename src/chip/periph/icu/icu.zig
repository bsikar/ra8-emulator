//! The ICU event-link table: how a peripheral event becomes an NVIC line.
//!
//! On this part a peripheral does not own an interrupt line. It raises a
//! numbered event, and the Interrupt Controller Unit decides which of its 96
//! NVIC lines that event drives: IELSR[n].IELS holds the event number line n
//! listens for, and firmware writes it there (`ra8_isr_register` /
//! `ra8_icu_route`) before it enables the line. Until this file existed the
//! Zig tree had no path from a block to an interrupt at all: src/chip/periph/sci.zig
//! landed with its transmit and receive interrupts deliberately left out,
//! because there was nothing to raise them into, so an interrupt-driven
//! `ra8_sci_write` printed nothing and waited forever on a flag its handler
//! was supposed to set. Ported from the ICU half of board_periph.c on dev.
//!
//!   IELSR[0..95] (+0x6300, 32-bit each, one per NVIC line)
//!     IELS[9:0]  the event this line listens for, 0 = unlinked
//!     IR    [16] the latched interrupt status flag, WRITE ZERO to clear
//!     DTCE  [24] DTC activation: the slot hands its event to the DTC
//!
//! An access carries a width, and IELSR is a word whose three fields sit in
//! three different bytes of it: IELS at the bottom, IR in byte 2, DTCE in
//! byte 3. A byte or halfword access is served through src/chip/periph/lanes.zig,
//! the same rule the SCI, PORT and ELC blocks already apply.
//!
//! Only IELSR is registered on the bus. The rest of the ICU (IRQCR, the NMI
//! block, the wake-up masks, SELSR) is nobody's yet, and the sparse register
//! file answers a poll of an unmodelled register better than a block that
//! flatly returns zero for it, so the block claims the table and no more.
