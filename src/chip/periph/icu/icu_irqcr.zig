//! IRQCRa/IRQCRb: the external-IRQ pins' detection sense and digital filter.
//!
//! Thirty-two external IRQ pins each get one control byte (HUM Ch 14.2.12
//! "IRQCRi : IRQ Control Register" p 535): IRQMD[1:0] picks the detection
//! sense, FCLKSEL[1:0] the filter's sampling clock, FLTEN turns the filter
//! on. The thirty-two bytes come in two runs, IRQCRa for channels 0..15 at
//! the top of R_ICU and IRQCRb for channels 16..31 four bytes past the end
//! of the first run, the gap and the offsets taken from
//! ra8_icu_regs.h's offset enum (k_ra8_icu_off_irqcra0 = 0x0000,
//! k_ra8_icu_off_irqcrb0 = 0x0014, k_ra8_icu_irqcrb_offset = 4).
//!
//! src/chip/periph/icu.zig claimed only IELSR and said so in its own header: the
//! rest of the ICU was "nobody's yet". So these thirty-two bytes fell through
//! to the sparse register file, which takes any store and gives it back, and
//! the one ordering rule the part puts on them went unwatched.
//!
//! THE RULE: ra8_icu.h says over ra8_icu_configure_irq_pin that per HUM
//! 14.2.12 IRQCRi may only be rewritten while the matching IELSRn register
//! is 0, meaning while no event is routed, and that the caller must order
//! its init sequence accordingly. A firmware that changes a pin's sense or
//! filter while the ICU is still routing that pin's event is reconfiguring
//! an input the controller is actively watching.
//!
//! NOT REFUSED, AND NOT GUESSED. The manual phrases this as a prohibition
//! and nothing in this tree says what the part actually does with such a
//! store: whether it is dropped, taken late, or taken with a glitch on the
//! pin. So the store lands exactly as it always did and the run counts it,
//! the same cut the DOTF reversed-pair and OCTACLK early-release slices took
//! for prohibited states with an unstated consequence. A store that lands
//! the value already there is not a rewrite and is not counted.
//!
//! The routed question is asked of the live IELSR table rather than a copy,
//! so a firmware that unroutes the event, reconfigures, and routes it again
//! is quiet, which is the sequence the warning asks for.
