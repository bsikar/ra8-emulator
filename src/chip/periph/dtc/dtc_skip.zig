//! DTCCR.RRS: the read-skip cache, which is why an edited descriptor can go
//! unseen.
//!
//! The controller keeps no transfer state in its own registers: every
//! activation reads a sixteen-byte TI block out of RAM, moves what it says,
//! and writes it back (src/chip/periph/dtc_xfer.zig). RRS is the one exception.
//! With it set, an activation whose vector number matches the previous one
//! skips that read and works from the copy the controller is still holding.
//! Clearing RRS drops the copy, which is the only way firmware has to make
//! the controller look at RAM again.
//!
//! That is not a performance detail, it is a correctness trap, and the
//! in-tree driver is built around it: `ra8_dtc_reconfigure` stops the block,
//! rewrites DTCVBR, cleans the CPU's cache lines out to memory, and then
//! writes DTCCR twice, 0x08 then 0x18, purely so "the read-skip cache picks
//! up the fresh entries" (ra8_dtc.c). A model that stores RRS and reads from
//! RAM every time makes that toggle decoration: firmware that edits a
//! descriptor in place and forgets the toggle works here and moves stale
//! bytes on a bench.
//!
//! The two DTCCR values are 0x08 and 0x18 rather than 0x00 and 0x10 because
//! bit 3 is reserved write-as-1 (ra8_dtc_regs.h, HUM Ch 18.2.1 p 786), so the
//! enable test below masks RRS out of the byte instead of comparing it whole.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the write-back. This block skips the READ,
//! which is what the field is named for and what the driver's comment
//! describes; neither tree says whether silicon also holds the spent
//! descriptor back from RAM while RRS is set, so it is written back on every
//! activation as before. Nor is DTCCR's reserved bit 3 forced up on readback:
//! the header calls it read-as-1, but that is a separate observable from this
//! one and belongs to its own slice.
