//! GPT compare match: the compare/capture values a channel carries, and
//! whether the up-counter has passed one.
//!
//! GTCCRA and GTCCRB were storage here. A store landed in the channel's
//! shadow, a read gave the value back, and nothing ever looked at it, so
//! GTST.TCFA could not rise and an image waiting on a compare match waited
//! out its whole budget. dev's board_periph_timer.c has the same hole from a
//! different direction: it names k_gtst_tcfa in its status enumeration and
//! then raises only TCFPO, and it answers zero to every offset outside the
//! seven it interprets, so on that tree GTCCRA does not even read back.
//!
//! The six compare/capture registers sit at +0x4C through +0x60, one word
//! each, from ra8-firmware's ra8_gpt_regs.h on zig/dev (`GTCCR[6]`, between
//! GTCNT at +0x48 and GTPR at +0x64). That header is what the GPT file's own
//! note said did not exist; it does, so A and B are compared here. The two
//! buffer halves, GTCCR[2] and GTCCR[3], now feed A and B at the end of a
//! cycle through src/chip/periph/gpt_buffer.zig, which reads GTBER. GTCCRD and
//! GTCCRF stay shadowed: they are capture registers and there is no capture
//! input in this model.
//!
//! THE FLAG POSITIONS. dev's enumeration gives three of GTST's bits by name:
//! TCFA bit 0, TCFPO bit 6, TCFPU bit 7. TCFB is not in it. Bit 1 is taken
//! for it here because the three that ARE named are exactly the HUM ordering
//! that runs TCFA..TCFF through bits 0..5 with the two period flags above
//! them, and because a compare B that shares A's flag would make the report
//! lie about which register matched. It is a derivation from the bits dev
//! names, not a bit table anyone in either tree has written down.
//!
//! MODEL'S OWN RULE, carried from the AGT and ULPT files for the same reason:
//! a compare value of zero is unarmed. The per-source enables live in GTINTAD
//! at +0x38, which this tree does not interpret, and without them a compare
//! sitting at its reset value of zero would match on every wrap of every
//! channel a firmware happens to start.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the compare-match interrupt. GPT0's counter
//! overflow is the one event number this tree carries for the block, so a
//! match sets its flag and is counted and the event path still sees only the
//! overflow. Nothing here writes to the counter either: compare match in PWM
//! mode clears GTCNT through GTCR's mode bits, and those are not modelled, so
//! the period is still the only thing that wraps the count.
