//! DOTF conversion area: which XSPI addresses a channel decrypts over.
//!
//! CONVAREAST and CONVAREAD do not hold a byte address. The bottom twelve
//! bits are reserved and the hardware scales the stored value by 4 KB, so a
//! region is 4 KB aligned and 4 KB granular (ra8_dotf_regs.h, HUM Ch 45.3.1
//! and 45.3.2 p 3049). The two registers also read back differently: the
//! start register's reserved field reads as zero, the end register's reads
//! as one, which the header quotes from the HUM outright ("These bits are
//! read as 1"). A driver that reads CONVAREAD back and compares it against
//! what it wrote is reading a value the hardware changed under it.
//!
//! Each channel is also bound to one XSPI window and decrypts nothing
//! outside it: DOTF0 over XSPI0 at 0x8000_0000..0x9FFF_FFFF, DOTF1 over
//! XSPI1 at 0x7000_0000..0x7FFF_FFFF (ra8_dotf_regs.h
//! ra8_dotf_xspi_window_t, HUM Ch 45.3 p 3049).
//!
//! TWO THINGS THE PAIR CAN BE ASKED FOR THAT SILICON DOES NOT ALLOW, and
//! both were silent here. The HUM records each as a requirement on the
//! driver without saying what the hardware does when it is broken, so
//! neither is refused: the store lands and the run says so, the same cut
//! src/chip/periph/pfs_route.zig makes for a prohibited pin handover.
//!
//! A REVERSED PAIR. "Setting CONVAREAST[31:12] > CONVAREAED[31:12] is
//! prohibited" (HUM Ch 45.3.1 p 3049, quoted in ra8_dotf.c
//! internal_validate_region, which returns invalid-arg for it). It is why
//! FSP writes the two registers END FIRST: r_ospi_b.c says "Set the end and
//! start area for DOTF conversion in that order to ensure that end address
//! is always higher than start address", and ra8_dotf_select_region follows
//! it. Programming start first and end second passes through start > end = 0
//! on the way, which is the ordinary sequence and not the prohibited state,
//! so a pair whose END is still at its reset value names nothing to count.
//!
//! A LIVE AREA CHANGE. ra8_dotf_select_region carries the precondition
//! "Channel is currently disabled (HUM 45.3.1 p 3049)" and expects the
//! caller to have run ra8_dotf_disable first. Moving the conversion area
//! underneath a running AES core hands the decrypting path a region the
//! firmware has half-replaced, and an image that does it reads plaintext
//! for one region and ciphertext for the other with nothing to say which.
