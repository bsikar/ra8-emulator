//! The I3C channel's register window, and what an access of each width names
//! inside it.
//!
//! Split out of `src/chip/periph/i3c.zig`, which owns the transfer machine, the
//! device registry and the counters. This file owns the access rule alone.
//!
//! EVERY REGISTER IN THIS WINDOW IS A WORD (HUM Ch 40, ra8_i3c_regs.h): the
//! condition request at +0x140, the data port at +0x158, the bus status at
//! +0x1D0, the transfer status at +0x1E0, the bus-condition status at +0x210.
//! `i3c.zig` switched on the exact byte offset of an access and ignored its
//! width, and indexed its shadow by `offset / 4`, so a narrow access anywhere
//! inside a register was answered by, and landed on, the whole word. Three
//! things followed, all of them wrong on silicon.
//!
//! A NARROW READ ANSWERED THE WRONG LANE. A byte read of BST+1, which is how
//! a driver tests TENDF on its own, was served the whole status word cut to
//! its low byte: the START, STOP and NACK flags answering in place of the
//! transfer-end flag it asked for.
//!
//! A NARROW STORE OVERWROTE THE LANES IT DID NOT NAME. A byte store into the
//! third byte of a configuration register put its value at the bottom of the
//! word and cleared everything above it, so a driver writing one field of a
//! register it had already programmed lost the rest.
//!
//! AND AN ACK CLEARED FLAGS IT NEVER NAMED. BST is write-0-to-clear, so the
//! model ANDs the written value into it. A byte store carries zeros in the
//! twenty-four bits above the lane it names, and those zeros cleared TENDF at
//! b8, ALF at b16 and TODF at b20: a handler acknowledging the START
//! condition with a byte store wiped the transfer-end and arbitration-lost
//! flags on its way past, and the driver waiting on TENDF waited forever.
//!
//! The rule now is the bus's, the same one `src/chip/periph/lanes.zig` already
//! serves the PORT, SCI, ELC, ICU and DMAC windows: a read is served from the
//! word the access lands in and cut to the lanes it names, a narrow store is
//! merged into that word so the lanes it does not name keep what they had,
//! and a write-0-to-clear register is cleared only in the lanes the store
//! actually named.
