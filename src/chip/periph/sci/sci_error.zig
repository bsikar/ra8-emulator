//! A serial channel's error latches: what CSR reports that firmware has to
//! clear rather than outgrow.
//!
//! Split out of src/chip/periph/sci.zig, which owns the channel, the data port and
//! the transmit gate. The bits themselves and the clear lines over them are
//! src/chip/periph/sci_status.zig's; this file owns whether one is standing.
//!
//! WHY A LATCH AND NOT A DERIVED BIT. TDRE, TEND and RDRF are facts about the
//! moment: the transmitter is drained, or the receive ring has a byte. ORER
//! is a fact about something that ALREADY HAPPENED and that only firmware can
//! acknowledge, so draining the ring must not put it down. That is the whole
//! difference, and it is why CFCLR.ORERC is the one line of either clear
//! strobe that does anything.
//!
//! ONLY ORER LIVES HERE SO FAR. FER and PER are the other two flags
//! ra8_sci_get_errors reads out of CSR, and neither has a source in this
//! model: there is no baud clock to frame against and no line to hear noise
//! on. When one gets a source it belongs in this struct beside the overrun,
//! which is why this is a struct of flags rather than a bare bool.
