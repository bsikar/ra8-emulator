//! CSR, FRSR and FTSR: the SCI_B status words a polled driver lives on, and
//! what a store to one does.
//!
//! Split out of src/chip/periph/sci.zig, which owns the channel, the line capture
//! and the transmit gate. This file owns the three words the controller
//! writes and firmware only reads, and the two clear strobes that sit beside
//! them.
//!
//! THE BITS THE DRIVER WANTS ARE IN THE TOP BYTE. TDRE is bit 29, TEND bit
//! 30 and RDRF bit 31, so a driver polling the transmitter with a byte load
//! reads CSR+3, and one watching RXDMON (bit 15) reads the halfword at CSR+0.
//! Those are ordinary accesses on silicon, and this file exists partly so
//! the window answers them: sci.zig used to switch on the raw byte offset,
//! so a load at CSR+3 matched no register at all and fell through to zero.
//! A `while ((REG8(CSR + 3) & TDRE) == 0)` on that answer never leaves its
//! loop, and the run dies at the instruction budget with the console silent.
//!
//! A STORE TO ONE OF THEM IS REFUSED, NOT SWALLOWED. CSR, FRSR and FTSR are
//! status: the transmitter and the FIFOs set those bits, firmware does not.
//! sci.zig used to drop such a store on the floor with the same `else => {}`
//! that serves CFCLR and FFCLR, so a driver storing CSR to force a flag was
//! told nothing and the run reported nothing. It is refused and counted
//! here, the way this tree already treats MSTATR, MRCPS, SRAMESR and INTS.
//!
//! CFCLR AND FFCLR ARE ACCEPTED, and most of what they name is a no-op.
//! They are write-1-to-clear strobes, and TDRE, TEND and RDRF are derived
//! here rather than latched: the first two never go down and the third
//! follows the receive queue, so clearing them changes nothing and refusing
//! them would report a driver doing exactly what the hardware manual asks of
//! it. ORER IS THE ONE THAT IS A LATCH, so CFCLR.ORERC is the one bit of
//! either strobe that does something.
//!
//! ORER HAS A SOURCE HERE, and it is the receive ring. The ring is a fixed
//! 512 bytes with no allocator below the bus, so a host or a device that
//! drives more than the firmware has read out loses the excess, and
//! sci.zig's Ring has always counted it. That IS an overrun: a character
//! arrived with the previous one still unread, which is what CSR.ORER
//! (bit 24, HUM Ch 38.2.17 p 2225) reports and what ra8_sci_get_errors
//! turns into k_ra8_sci_err_overrun. The bit read clear forever, so a run
//! that dropped characters told the driver its line was clean and the
//! error path was never entered: the firmware saw a short message rather
//! than a reported overrun, which is the worse of the two directions for a
//! model to be wrong in. It latches now, and only CFCLR.ORERC
//! (bit 24, HUM Ch 38.2.24 p 2238, and inside ra8_sci.c's own
//! k_ra8_sci_cfclr_default = 0x9D070010) puts it down.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: FER and PER, and the receiver halt. The
//! other two error flags have no source here, because there is no baud clock
//! to frame against and no line to see noise on, so they still read clear
//! rather than being raised on an invented fault. Nor does a raised ORER
//! stop the receiver: silicon holds the next character off until the flag is
//! cleared, and nothing in this tree states that, so the ring keeps taking
//! what fits and the flag stays up until the strobe clears it. Both are
//! their own slice if an image ever needs them.
