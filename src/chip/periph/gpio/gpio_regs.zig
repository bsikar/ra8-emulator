//! The register map of one PORT instance, and what an access of each width
//! names inside it.
//!
//! Split out of src/chip/periph/gpio.zig, which owns the pins, the board LEDs and
//! the externally-driven inputs. This file owns the map alone: which word an
//! offset lands in, which 16-bit half an access names, and which of those
//! halves the port itself owns so a store to one is a refusal.
//!
//! EVERY PCNTR WORD IS A PAIR OF 16-BIT REGISTERS, AND FIRMWARE USES BOTH
//! NAMES. The RA8 header declares the four combined words and, in the same
//! union, the eight halves they are made of (HUM Ch 20.2 p 730-736,
//! ra8_port_regs.h):
//!
//!   0x00 PCNTR1 = {PODR[31:16], PDR[15:0]}   0x00 PDR   0x02 PODR
//!   0x04 PCNTR2 = {EIDR[31:16], PIDR[15:0]}  0x04 PIDR  0x06 EIDR
//!   0x08 PCNTR3 = {PORR[31:16], POSR[15:0]}  0x08 POSR  0x0A PORR
//!   0x0C PCNTR4 = {EORR[31:16], EOSR[15:0]}  0x0C EOSR  0x0E EORR
//!
//! `R_PORT6->PODR |= bit` is a halfword access at +0x02, and it is how most
//! hand-written board code drives a pin. gpio.zig used to switch on the raw
//! byte offset of an access and ignore its width, so only a 32-bit access
//! aimed at a word's first byte matched anything: the halfword at +0x02 fell
//! to `else => {}` on write and `else => 0` on read. An LED driven that way
//! never lit, a `PODR` read back to confirm the write answered zero, and the
//! run reported nothing wrong. Serving the word the access lands in and then
//! cutting it to the lanes the access names is what makes both spellings of
//! the same register agree.
//!
//! PCNTR2 IS THE PORT'S, AND A STORE TO IT IS REFUSED. PIDR is the live pin
//! level and EIDR the event input: the pads drive those, firmware does not.
//! A store there used to be dropped silently; it is refused and counted now,
//! the way this tree already treats MSTATR, MRCPS, SRAMESR, INTS and the SCI
//! status words.
//!
//! PCNTR4 STAYS AN ACCEPTED NO-OP, and that is not the same thing. The event
//! output link is genuinely writable on silicon and genuinely unmodelled
//! here, so a store is taken and forgotten rather than refused: refusing it
//! would report a driver doing something the hardware allows.
