//! The RIIC target (peripheral) role: the emulator is the external controller.
//!
//! Once firmware programmes an own address (SARLy) and enables its slot
//! (ICSER.SARyE), the part answers as a target and something else on the bus
//! drives the clock. Headless there is nothing else, so this model IS that
//! controller: it writes a known payload at the firmware's own address, reads
//! it back, and checks the firmware echoed what it was sent.
//!
//! A CONTROLLER ENDS A READ BY NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THE LAST BYTE IT WANTED.
//! ra8_i2c_peripheral.c's own state diagram says so in the TX_ACTIVE box
//! ("push ICDRT while TDRE set and no NACK, until len") and its exit arrow
//! ("NACK (controller end) or sent == len"), and the two predicates behind
//! that box test the bit directly:
//!
//!     priv_ra8_i2c_internal_peripheral_tx_continue(icsr2, sent, len)
//!       = (icsr2 & nackf) == 0 && sent < len
//!     priv_ra8_i2c_internal_peripheral_tx_done(icsr2)
//!       = (icsr2 & nackf) != 0 || (icsr2 & tend) != 0
//!
//! This model never raised NACKF, so the controller's end of the frame was
//! invisible: tx_continue stayed true and the send loop ran to the CALLER'S
//! buffer length rather than stopping at the bytes the controller asked for,
//! and internal_i2c_target_finish_tx then passed its TEND|NACKF wait only on
//! the TEND this model leaves standing for the whole phase, which is a wait
//! passing for the wrong reason. The run then counted every extra byte and
//! called the echo MISMATCHED, blaming firmware for a NACK nothing sent.
//!
//! So the read phase now NACKs and stops once it has the bytes it wanted,
//! and a phase ends on the fall of the flag it was waiting on rather than on
//! any ICSR2 write at all. ICSR2 is write-0-to-clear and the driver clears
//! several bits in one store (finish_tx clears NACKF and STOP together), so
//! the rule is about WHICH bit fell, not that a store happened: clearing
//! RDRF between payload bytes, or clearing the error flags mid-frame the way
//! ra8_i2c_clear_errors does, no longer skips the script forward a phase.
