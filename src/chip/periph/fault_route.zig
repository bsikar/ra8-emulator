//! Which exception a configurable fault is taken as, and at what priority.
//!
//! MemManage, BusFault, UsageFault and SecureFault are each a configurable fault with its
//! own enable in SHCSR and its own priority byte in SHPR1. A fault that is
//! disabled, or that cannot preempt what is running because its priority is
//! no more urgent than the current execution priority, escalates to
//! HardFault and sets HFSR.FORCED (DDI0553 B3.9). The status the fault
//! latched in CFSR stays where it was either way, so the HardFault handler
//! can read what really happened.
