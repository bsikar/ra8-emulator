//! These are the reader's own questions, not the board's account of itself:
//! a named global read out of RAM, one card block as hex, the core
//! registers as the run left them. They come after the block reports and
//! they answer to a flag, so a run that passed none of those flags prints
//! nothing from this file at all.
//!
//! Its own file rather than four more functions in src/main.zig, which is
//! wiring: this is output, it is the only part of the output that a flag
//! rather than the board decides, and src/board is where the words about a
//! run live.
