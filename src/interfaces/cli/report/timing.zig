//! Two cycle numbers rather than one, because they answer different
//! questions. How far the run got is a property of the run. What DWT_CYCCNT
//! holds is a property of the firmware, which only counts once it arms the
//! counter, and on this corpus most images never do. Printing only the
//! second made a run that covered two million instructions report zero.
//!
//! A third number when a run spent time in a spin: the cycles that were
//! charged without being executed, because the machine had been stepped back
//! to the state it started in and nothing it did on the way could be seen.
//! It is reported rather than hidden because it is the difference between a
//! run that idled and a run that worked, and the reader cannot tell them
//! apart from the elapsed count alone. The rest of the file names the
//! sites behind the run's counters: counted pcs and where exceptions
//! were taken.
