//! The DMAC half of the end-of-run report. Split out of report.zig, which is
//! at the file-length limit, and kept next to the other report_*.zig files.
//!
//! The DMAC has counted its requests, units, bytes, completions, faults and
//! refusals since the model was written, and until now nothing printed any of
//! them: a run where channels were refused or cut short said so nowhere, and
//! the only way to see it was to write a probe. The DTC, DRW and PDM all have
//! a line here, so the DMAC gets one on the same shape.
//!
//! The two loud cases are worth reading closely. A REFUSED request moved
//! nothing at all and reads back to firmware as a channel that simply did not
//! transfer, which on dev passes silently because dev copies whatever the
//! module-start bit says. A SHORT request is the newer one: memory refused an
//! address partway through, so the units before it stayed, the counts went
//! back as they stood, and the channel is still armed over a transfer it
//! never finished.
