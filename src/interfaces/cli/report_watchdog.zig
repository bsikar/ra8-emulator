/// How often the firmware refreshed the watchdog, in the unit the model
/// actually counts.
///
/// WHY A RATE AND NOT JUST A COUNT. A refresh count on its own cannot be
/// judged. A supervisor declares its cadence in milliseconds in its own
/// source, and the only way to check the model against that was to go and
/// read the run length and divide, by hand, every time. Stating the rate
/// here turns the comparison into reading one line.
///
/// Measured on `wdt_supervisor_demo`, which is why this exists:
/// `examples/ek_ra8d2/hw_validated/hil/wdt_supervisor_demo/src/main.c` sets
/// `k_wdt_sup_demo_sup_period_ms = 50` and passes it as the supervisor's
/// `refresh_period_ms`, and its ThreadX tick is 1 kHz, so one refresh every
/// 50 SysTick periods is what the firmware asks for. The run reports 296
/// refreshes over 200 periods, which is one every 0.7, about seventy times
/// too often. That is a real defect and it was sitting in plain sight
/// behind a bare count.
///
/// SysTick periods rather than milliseconds on purpose. A period is a thing
/// this model counts; a millisecond is a thing it would have to infer from
/// a reload the firmware programmed, and saying "ms" for a run whose tick
/// is not 1 kHz would be a quiet lie. A reader comparing against a firmware
/// that declares ms on a 1 kHz tick reads the two as the same number.
