    \\  --instructions N   stop after N instructions (default 2000000,
    \\                     or 200000000 when --stop-sym is watching)
    \\  --ms N             stop after N milliseconds of modelled time,
    \\                     counted in the SysTick periods the firmware
    \\                     itself armed
    \\  --part NAME        ra8d2 (default) or ra8p1, which carries the NPU
    \\  --sd IMAGE         attach a raw SDHC image (size must be a whole 512 KiB unit)
    \\  --sd-save IMAGE    the same card, written back over IMAGE when the
    \\                     run ends (temp file, fsync, rename); --sd
    \\                     leaves IMAGE untouched
    \\  --sd-image IMAGE   back the SDHI card with a raw image (whole 512 KiB
    \\                     units); writes stay in memory unless --sd-writable,
    \\                     which writes the card back over IMAGE at the end
    \\  --sd-dir DIR       back the SDHI card with a FAT32 image built from DIR,
    \\                     the same bytes every build (dotfiles skipped)
    \\  --device NAME      the same thing, spelled the way the firmware's
    \\                     own emulator-in-the-loop suite spells it
    \\  --dump-sym NAME    read that global out of RAM after the run and
    \\                     print it, repeatable
    \\  --stop-sym NAME N  end the run early once that global reaches N
    \\  --until TEXT       end the run early once a console line contains
    \\                     TEXT, as the bench's uart_scrape does
    \\  --break-sym PLACE [N]
    \\                     end the run when execution reaches PLACE, on
    \\                     the Nth arrival (default the first); the report
    \\                     says how many arrivals a run that fell short
    \\                     did see. PLACE is a function, an address, or
    \\                     either with a +/- offset, which is how to stop
    \\                     just after a call and read what it returned.
    \\                     --break-at is the same flag, spelled for an
    \\                     address rather than a name
    \\  --cpu1 IMAGE.elf   start the second core on that image, against the
    \\                     same board: shared RAM, shared peripherals. The
    \\                     two cores take turns a chunk at a time. CPU0
    \\                     keeps the clocks and the interrupt controller.
    \\  --ns IMAGE.elf     also load a TrustZone Non-Secure image at its
    \\                     load addresses, where the Secure boot copies it from
    \\  --sd-size MB       size the card on the SPI line (default 32)
    \\  --trace-sd         write one line per SD command to stderr
    \\  --dump-sd BLOCK    print that card block as hex after the run
    \\  --dump-mem PLACE [N] (repeatable, printed in order)
    \\                     print N words (default 4) out of memory at
    \\                     PLACE, which is an address, a symbol, or
    \\                     @symbol to follow the pointer it holds, any of
    \\                     them with a +/- offset applied afterwards
    \\  --watch PLACE      record every store that lands in that word, with
    \\                     the pc that made it and the function it sits in.
    \\                     Takes the same place spelling as --dump-mem, minus
    \\                     the dereference: the address has to be known
    \\                     before the run starts
    \\  --trace-rtos       record each ThreadX thread switch, the stores to
    \\                     _tx_thread_current_ptr, stamped with modelled time
    \\  --trace-rtos-out FILE
    \\                     --trace-rtos, and write the trace to FILE (CPU1's
    \\                     to FILE.cpu1) as text a reader can take back
    \\  --frame-out PATH   write what the panel shows at the end as a PNG
    \\  --panel-only       write just the panel, at its own size
    \\  --frames-out DIR   write numbered P6 panel frames
    \\  --gif-out PATH     write sampled panel frames as an animated GIF
    \\  --frames-every N   consider every Nth scanned frame (default 1)
    \\  --frame-on-settle DIR capture numbered P6 frames as the panel settles
    \\  --settle-window-ms N require N ms of unchanged GLCDC pixels (default 50)
    \\  --gui              show the run live in a window (a -Dgui build)
    \\  --window-stills DIR with --gui, keep numbered PNGs of the window
    \\  --window-stills-every N keep the first frame and every Nth after it
    \\  --audio-out PATH   write what SSIE0 transmitted as a WAV (Zig core)
    \\  --audio-rate HZ    the WAV's sample rate; no audio clock (default 48000)
    \\  --report json      print the run and cores report as one JSON line
    \\  --cpu-load         CPU load per ThreadX thread and per ISR, on each
    \\                     core, over the whole run
    \\  ctl cpu-load       run an image once and print only its per-core load
    \\                     object; --from and --to select instruction bounds
    \\  --profile          count retired instructions and modelled cycles
    \\                     by ELF function, most cycles first
    \\  --profile-folded   also write one function count per folded row
    \\  --count-pc ADDR    count every execution of the instruction at that
    \\                     address, repeatable up to four times. For
    \\                     settling a disagreement between two counters
    \\                     that are each one step removed from the
    \\                     instruction itself
    \\  --stop-on-undefined
    \\                     end the run the first time it reaches an
    \\                     instruction the architecture leaves undefined,
    \\                     before that instruction executes, so a dump
    \\                     beside it reads the state on the way in
    \\  --dump-regs        print the argument registers and the words at
    \\                     the stack pointer after the run; at a break
    \\                     they are still the arguments of the function
    \\                     stopped on
    \\  --sd-new FS        format that card: fat16 or fat32, with an
    \\                     optional volume label after a colon
    \\  --touch X,Y        queue a contact on the touch panel, repeatable
    \\  --touch-seq X:Y,X:Y  queue several contacts in order
    \\  --touch @PATH      read live touches from PATH (a file or FIFO)
    \\                     while the run goes: one "X,Y" per line, with
    \\                     an optional "down "/"move " in front; "up"
    \\                     and blank lines add nothing; "sw1 down",
    \\                     "sw1 up", "sw2 down" and "sw2 up" hold and
    \\                     release the user switches (P009, P008)
    \\  --battery PCT      state-of-charge the fuel gauge reports (default 72)
    \\  --charge           report the charger attached, so the charge rate
    \\                     the gauge answers with is positive
    \\  --click            fit the Click module: LSM6DSO 0x6B, MAX17048 0x36
    \\  --attach M@E       attach model M (lsm6dso, max17048, eink, modem, button,

    \\                     uart:sci3, gpio:P006 (up to 4 times); eink:WxH@E
    \\                     sizes the panel (default 1072x1448)
    \\  --fault M@E=MODE   misbehave an --attach part: disconnected, nack:N,

    \\                     nothing maps, instead of the precise BusFault
    \\                     the part raises (the default); --bus-errors is
    \\                     still accepted
    \\  --rtc-start T      start the RTC running at T (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS or
    \\                     now, UTC) and count virtual time
    \\  --realtime         pace virtual time against the host clock at 1x

    \\  --speed F          pace at F times real time (0.1, 0.25, 5, 100...),

    \\  --run-for D        run D of virtual time (30s, 90m, 12h, 7d), in

    \\  --no-idle-skip     a core asleep in WFI/WFE with nothing pending
    \\                     crosses every boundary instead of running
    \\                     straight to its next edge (the default;

    \\  --camera-source K  where the camera engine's pixels come from:
