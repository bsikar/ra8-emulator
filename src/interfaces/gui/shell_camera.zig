//! The shell's camera leaf (RA8EMU-796): the camera panel (RA8EMU-500,
//! RA8EMU-677) drawn in the leaf, its clicks routed into the panel, and each
//! pick sent to the session with set_camera_source (RA8EMU-795). The webcam
//! passes the panel's own consent dialog first, so only then does the ask
//! carry allow_webcam. The panel's ring follows the source the session runs:
//! a refusal, or a kind that still needs a file, puts it back on the last
//! source the session took. The kind that needed a file is kept in `wants`
//! for the leaf's file field (RA8EMU-799).
