//! Opening another image while the window is up (RA8EMU-959), the shell's

//! window for the OS's own file picker. The path it sends back is read here
//! and loaded into the session the way the first image was, so the board
//! comes back halted at the new image's reset vector. A file that cannot be
//! read, or is longer than a load carries, never reaches the session, and
//! one the session refuses leaves the image that was there as it was; either
//! way the status strip says so. The window's title names the image in use.
