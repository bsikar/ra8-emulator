//! Formatting a blank card: solve the volume geometry for the card's own
//! size, then lay the metadata region out on it.
//!
//! dev builds a FAT volume in a fresh sparse host file behind `--sd-new`
//! (board_periph_sd_format.c). The card in this tree is the RAM-backed image
//! next door, so the same work lands in blocks instead of a file descriptor,
//! and the geometry solvers keep dev's shape. Five things that model does not
//! do:
//!
//! THE CLUSTER COUNT DECIDES THE TYPE. dev formats whatever it is asked for.
//! Its FAT16 solver doubles the cluster size until the count fits, and when
//! it runs out of cluster sizes it gives up and writes the BPB anyway, so a
//! large card comes back stamped "FAT16   " over more clusters than a 16-bit
//! FAT can address; the same routine writes "FAT32   " over a volume with far
//! too few. Either one is a card whose own cluster count contradicts the type
//! it declares, which is how a driver picks the wrong FAT width and walks off
//! the end of the table. Here the counts the specification fixes are checked
//! and a volume outside them is refused.
//!
//! A CARD TOO SMALL IS NOT FORMATTED. dev subtracts the reserved and root
//! regions from the sector count in unsigned arithmetic with no floor under
//! it, so a card smaller than its own metadata wraps and produces a BPB for a
//! volume that does not exist. Refused here.
//!
//! A FORMAT CLEARS WHAT WAS THERE. dev writes the boot sector and the head of
//! each FAT copy and nothing else. On a fresh sparse file that is enough; on
//! a card that already holds something it is not, and the rest of the FAT,
//! the root directory and the reserved region all survive the format, so the
//! volume mounts showing entries from the card before it. Here the whole
//! metadata region is given back first.
//!
//! A LABEL THAT DOES NOT FIT IS NOT A LABEL. dev pads at eleven bytes and
//! truncates anything longer in silence, and copies any byte at all into the
//! field, control characters included. Refused here; see sd_fat.zig.
//!
//! THE BACKUP IS A WHOLE BACKUP. dev copies the boot sector to the backup at
//! sector 6 and leaves the FSInfo that belongs with it unwritten, so a repair
//! falling back to the backup finds half a pair. Both are written here.
