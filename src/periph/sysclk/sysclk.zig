//! The system clock tree: which source drives it, and the dividers under it.
//!
//! (SYSC base 0x4001_E000, HUM Ch 9.2.5 "SCKSCR", 9.2.6 "SCKDIVCR",
//! 9.2.7 "SCKDIVCR2".)
//!
//!   SCKDIVCR  (+0x020, 32b) FCLK, ICLK, PCLKE, BCLK, PCLKA..D dividers
//!   SCKDIVCR2 (+0x024, 16b) CPUCLK0, CPUCLK1, NPUCLK, MRICLK dividers
//!   SCKSCR    (+0x026,  8b) CKSEL[2:0], the source the whole tree runs on
//!
//! THE GAP THIS CLOSES. None of the three was modelled, so all of them fell to
//! the bus catch-all, which stores what it is handed and reads it back. Two
//! consequences. Every store landed whether or not PRC0 was open, and the run
//! could say nothing at all about the clock tree: 26 of the 36 corpus images
//! programme these registers during bring-up and the report never mentioned
//! them, so a run had no way to show which source the firmware ended up on.
//!
//! PRCR.PRC0 GATES EVERY STORE HERE, the same rule `oscsf.zig` next door
//! already carries for the stop bits: these are clock-generation registers, and
//! ra8_lpm.h lines 572-573 record that "a write issued while PRC0 is locked is
//! discarded silently by the hardware" (HUM Ch 13.1 Table 13.1). No fault, no
//! status bit, the register simply keeps its old value. A store arriving with
//! PRC0 shut is dropped and counted, because counting it is the only way a run
//! can say it happened.
//!
//! The firmware is careful here and that is exactly why the gate matters.
//! internal_cgc_init_protected (ra8_cgc.c:688) runs the whole bring-up inside
//! RA8_PROTECTED_WRITE(k_ra8_prcr_unlock_cgc), and its last two steps are
//! internal_program_dividers (both divider words) then SCKSCR = PLL1 at line
//! 722; ra8_cgc_use_hoco wraps its lone SCKSCR store at line 773; and
//! switch_pll1_target wraps each of its three at 823, 832 and 846. Every one of
//! those windows is a place a caller can get the protection wrong and lose the
//! write on silicon while a model that gates nothing carries on.
//!
//! SELECTING A SOURCE THAT IS NOT RUNNING IS COUNTED, NOT REFUSED. The driver
//! waits on the matching OSCSF flag before it dares select a source
//! (priv_ra8_cgc_wait_oscsf_set, called at every bring-up step), so a select
//! that skips the wait is a real firmware bug. But nothing in this tree records
//! the hardware REFUSING such a select, so this model does not invent a
//! refusal: the select lands, and the run says it happened. Only the four
//! sources with an OSCSF flag can be checked at all, so MOCO, LOCO and the
//! sub-clock are selected without comment.
//!
//! THE RESET VALUES OF THE TWO DIVIDER WORDS ARE NOT RECORDED in the firmware
//! tree, so nothing here claims one: both answer zero until firmware programmes
//! them, and the report stays silent about a tree that was never written. That
//! zero is the model's starting point, not a claim about silicon. SCKSCR is
//! different and is cited: ra8_cgc.h lines 241 and 380 both record that the
//! reset value "reads as 0 (... = HOCO ~20 MHz)", so CKSEL starts at HOCO.
//!
//! NO FREQUENCY IS DERIVED. The dividers are decoded to ratios for the report
//! (`sysclk_div.zig`) and nothing more: this model has no oscillator
//! frequencies behind it, and the modelled time base is charged per chunk
//! rather than per cycle (`clocks.zig`), so a rate computed here would be
//! decoration. Wiring real rates into the time base is its own slice.
