//! ADC_B: the 16-bit converter, and the scan group that has to be enabled
//! before a start means anything.
//!
//! The block sits at 0x4033_8000 with a 0x2224 window (ra8_adc_b_regs.h, FSP
//! R_ADC_B0_Type). A polling read drives it in three steps: programme an
//! ADCHCRn slot with the physical source and the scan group, kick the group
//! with ADSTR[group].ADST, then poll ADSR.ADACT0 until the unit is idle and
//! read the result out of ADDR[slot]. A conversion is instantaneous here, so
//! the poll completes on its first read.
//!
//! The arithmetic of a slot, which source it names and what that source
//! reports, lives next door in adc_scan.zig. This file owns the window, the
//! scan machine and what the run is told afterwards.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_adc.c on dev, with four things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! A SCAN GROUP HAS TO BE ENABLED. dev converts whichever slots name the
//! started group whether or not ADSGER, the scan-group enable it declares in
//! its own register map and then never reads, has that group's bit set. So an
//! image that programmes its channels and starts a scan without enrolling the
//! group reads real-looking results on dev and reads nothing back on silicon.
//! Here the start is refused and counted, and no result register moves.
//!
//! RESULTS AND STATUS ARE WHAT THE CONVERTER PUT THERE. dev's write path
//! drops any store anywhere in the window, ADSR and ADDR and ADEXDR included,
//! so firmware can write its own conversion result and read it back as
//! though the block produced it. Refused and counted here, the pattern
//! already taken for CETCR, SRAMESR and the CANFD status registers.
//!
//! THE START BIT DOES NOT STAY SET. dev latches the ADST it was given, so
//! ADSTR reads back as a scan in progress forever while ADSR in the same
//! breath reports the unit idle. The two cannot both be true. The scan
//! completes inside the store here, so ADST is spent by the time the store
//! returns, and a driver that polls either register gets the same answer.
//!
//! A NARROW WRITE ONLY TOUCHES THE BYTES IT NAMES. dev's `reg[off / 4] =
//! value` makes a byte store to ADSTR.ADST wipe the three bytes above it, and
//! a halfword store into an ADCHCRn slot wipe the source field.
//!
//! AN UNPROGRAMMED SLOT STILL READS AS GROUP 0 CHANNEL 0, which is dev's
//! behaviour and is kept: ADCHCRn powers up at zero, and zero is a legal
//! enrolment. So a scan of group 0 converts all twenty-four slots, where a
//! scan of any other group converts only the slots that name it. No header
//! in this tree gives a per-slot enable bit, and inventing one would be a
//! guess about silicon rather than a fix, so the count is reported instead
//! and an image that wants one channel gives it a group of its own.
//!
//! KEPT FROM DEV DELIBERATELY: the driver convention that a normal channel's
//! virtual slot index is also its ADDR index; the single ADC0 scan-end event
//! for every group, since no header in this tree gives a per-group one; and
//! the raise on a group with no channel enrolled, which is dev's behaviour
//! and not obviously wrong, though the empty scan is counted so a run that
//! never enrolled anything says so.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED AND NOT GUESSED: ADINTCR's per-group interrupt enable (the
//! event is raised whatever it holds), ADTRGENR and every hardware trigger,
//! the A/D error and overflow status bits, ADSR for units other than 0, and
//! the sampling-time and gain registers. They are shadowed so a read-modify-
//! write survives, and never read.
