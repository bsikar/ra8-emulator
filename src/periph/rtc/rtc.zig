//! RTC: the calendar that keeps time, and an alarm that goes off once.
//!
//! The RTC sits at 0x4020_2000 in an 0x80 window (ra8_rtc_regs.h). Firmware
//! brings it up by clearing RCR2 and waiting for the mode bit to read back,
//! setting HR24 and waiting again, writing the counters, then setting
//! RCR2.START; from there the counters advance on their own and an armed
//! RxxAR raises the alarm event. Every readback in that sequence is a poll
//! loop, so a register that does not answer is an image that never leaves
//! init, which is why the block is a faithful shadow with a real time mirror
//! behind it rather than a handful of interpreted bits.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_rtc.c on dev, with four things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! A COUNTER IS NOT WRITABLE WHILE THE CLOCK RUNS. dev stores into the
//! calendar counters whenever firmware asks and reseeds the running mirror
//! from them, so an image that sets the time without first clearing
//! RCR2.START works there and loses the write on silicon, where the counters
//! are only writable with the count stopped. Here the store is refused and
//! counted, so the run says which writes went nowhere.
//!
//! THE ALARM IS AN EDGE. dev re-evaluates the match every modelled second
//! and raises the event again on each one, so an alarm armed on the hour
//! alone raises 3600 events and reports 3600 alarms for what firmware asked
//! to be told about once. The match here has to become true to raise
//! anything, and re-arms only once the time no longer matches.
//!
//! THE WHOLE ALARM IS HONOURED. dev compares the second, minute and hour
//! registers and ignores the day, month and year alarms entirely, so an
//! alarm armed for a date fires on the first matching time of any day. The
//! day and month fields take part here on the same enable-bit rule, and
//! RYRAREN arms the year.
//!
//! R64CNT IS READ-ONLY. dev writes any offset in the window into its
//! shadow, R64CNT included, so firmware can store a sub-second count and
//! read its own invention back out of a free-running counter. Refused and
//! counted here.
//!
//! RCR2.RESET IS A COMMAND, NOT A SETTING. The bit auto-clears on silicon
//! and the driver polls it until it falls, so a shadow that answers 1 is an
//! image that never leaves bring-up. It is interpreted in rtc_reset.zig,
//! which carries the rule and says what the reset does and does not touch.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: RCR1.PES, so a periodic-enabled clock
//! offers one periodic event per modelled second whatever interval was
//! selected (ra8_rtc_regs.h names PES[3:0] at bits 4..7 and gives no
//! encoding table, and the driver only ever writes the register as zero);
//! the day-of-week counter and its alarm, which dev does not maintain
//! either; RCR2's adjustment and output bits, for the reasons rtc_reset.zig
//! gives. Those are shadowed for readback and never interpreted. RCR4's
//! count source used to sit on that list and no longer does: it is read in
//! rtc_source.zig, which carries the rule and says what is still not
//! modelled there.
