//! The extra-MRAM option window as memory the firmware can read.
//!
//! HUM Ch 59.7.4.5 Table 59.15 p 3592 puts every cell a Program command may
//! target between 0x02E0_7600 and 0x02E1_79F0 (mram_otp.zig). On silicon
//! that range is memory-mapped and an ordinary load reads it. Here nothing
//! mapped it: a landed program was written through to guest memory only if
//! something had already mapped the page, and nothing had, so the write
//! through failed and counted as faulted, and a plain read stopped the run
//! on an unmapped access.
//!
//! ra8_ftl_demo is the example that found it. Its FTL keeps its blocks in
//! this window and reads them with memcpy, so the run stopped in memcpy at
//! 0x0200C956 on a byte read of 0x02E0_A400 before the first act began.
//!
//! The pages covering the window are mapped when the controller is
//! attached and filled with the erased value, so a cell nobody has
//! programmed reads the same here as mram_otp.Cells.byte says it does.
//! Images link option-setting segments into this window (0x02E0_7600 and
//! 0x02E1_7700 in most of the corpus), so the order matters both ways: a
//! page an image already mapped is left alone, and the image loader skips
//! a page attach already mapped and writes its bytes over the fill.
