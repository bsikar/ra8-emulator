//! The far end of the wire: what the firmware has sent, and what is waiting

//! dev's peer is a state machine that answers ARP, pings back, and runs a TCP
//! echo (board_net.c, 849 lines). None of that is here yet. What the
//! descriptor engine needs from the far end is somewhere to put a frame and
//! somewhere to take one from, so that is what this is, and the protocol peer
//! is the next slice on top of it.
//!
//! The one thing this does that dev's sink does not: it is bounded and it
//! pushes back. dev's TX sink swallows every frame, so a descriptor is
//! completed whatever happened to it.
