//! The GPTP time itself: a free-running accumulator, an additive offset, and
//! the two views firmware reads them through.
//!
//! The block is a timer, not a transport. Each unit counts in 5.27
//! fixed-point nanoseconds per ESWCLK cycle (PTPTIVCt), and what firmware
//! reads is `offset + free-running`, the equation HUM 35.5.1.1 gives. The
//! arithmetic lives here so the register window next door stays a register
//! window.
//!
//! Split out of the port of board_periph_gptp.c on dev, with the carry done
//! properly: dev subtracts one second at most from the summed nanoseconds
//! and then masks the result to the field's thirty bits, so an offset whose
//! nanoseconds sit between one second and the 2^30 ceiling (a range the
//! field allows and dev commits unchanged) is reported as a nanoseconds
//! value at or above one second, which is not a time any clock can show.
//! Here the offset is normalized when it is committed and the sum is
//! carried to completion, so a nanoseconds read is always below one second
//! and the seconds it belonged to are in the seconds field.
