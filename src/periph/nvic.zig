//! The Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller: what is pending, and what taking
//! it does to the core.
//!
//! A CPU model only takes exceptions it raised itself. Nothing
//! here raises one: the PPB is plain RAM, so `NVIC->ISER[0] = 1 << n` and
//! `SysTick`'s pend in ICSR are words sitting in memory that the core will
//! never look at. Until this file existed, a firmware that armed SysTick with
//! TICKINT and then waited on a handler-updated flag spun out its whole
//! budget: the previous slice pended the exception, and nobody took it.
//!
//! So the controller is modelled host-side and runs at the chunk boundary,
//! the same seam the clocks are charged on. Taking an exception is done the
//! way the silicon does it (DDI0553 B3.19): stack the caller-saved frame,
//! load LR with an EXC_RETURN, and enter the handler from the vector table at
//! VTOR. Returning is the mirror: the handler branches to EXC_RETURN, which is
//! an unmapped fetch to such a model, and the run loop unwinds
//! the frame instead of reporting a fault.
