//! The SCB cache window: the geometry the firmware reads, and the
//! maintenance it asks for.
//!
//! `ra8_cache.c` drives eleven words in the PPB at 0xE000Exxx. The PPB is
//! plain RAM in this tree, so every one of them read as zero and a
//! maintenance store landed in a word nothing looked at. Two consequences,
//! one of them with teeth:
//!
//!   CTR read as zero, so `ra8_cache_dcache_line_bytes` answered four bytes
//!   instead of the 32 this core has. Every by-address maintenance call then
//!   did eight times the work: a clean over a 4 KiB DMA buffer wrote DCCMVAC
//!   1024 times rather than 128, inside a budget the run has to finish in.
//!   `ra8_spi_b_dma.c` rounds its staging buffers to the same number, so the
//!   wrong line size mis-sized those too.
//!
//!   Nothing could see that maintenance happened at all. The registers are
//!   write-only on silicon, and against RAM a write is indistinguishable
//!   from the zero already there.
//!
//! This block is a watcher on the PPB, like AIRCR in scb.zig and for the same
//! reason: the cache words are not on the peripheral bus, so they are primed
//! at attach and read at the chunk boundary rather than hooked per access.
//! The cost is the same one: an operation is noticed at the end of the chunk
//! it happened in, and a hundred stores inside one chunk are seen as one. The
//! report says boundaries, not stores, because boundaries is what this seam
//! can honestly count.
//!
//! Each maintenance register is primed with a sentinel rather than zero, so a
//! write of zero is still visible. 0xFFFFFFFF is safe as that sentinel: a
//! by-MVA register takes a line-aligned address and a set/way register takes
//! `(set << 5) | (way << 30)`, so neither can carry the low five bits the
//! sentinel sets, and ICIALLU is only ever written with zero.
//!
//!   CTR      0xE000ED7C  read-only, primed, a store is refused
//!   CCSIDR   0xE000ED80  read-only, primed, a store is refused
//!   CSSELR   0xE000ED84  read/write, the cache the walk selected
//!   CCR      0xE000ED14  read/write, watched for IC and DC
//!   ICIALLU  0xE000EF50  write-only, I-cache invalidate all
//!   DCIMVAC  0xE000EF5C  write-only, D-cache invalidate by address
//!   DCISW    0xE000EF60  write-only, D-cache invalidate by set/way
//!   DCCMVAC  0xE000EF68  write-only, D-cache clean by address
//!   DCCIMVAC 0xE000EF70  write-only, D-cache clean and invalidate by address
//!   DCCISW   0xE000EF74  write-only, D-cache clean+invalidate by set/way
