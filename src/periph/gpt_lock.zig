//! GTWP: the key a channel's registers stay shut behind.
//!
//! GTWP is the first word of every GPT channel window (+0x00,
//! `R_GPT0.GTWP` in ra8_gpt_regs.h line 56, "Write-Protection"). Bit 0 is
//! WP, the protection itself, and the upper byte is a password: a store only
//! reaches WP when it carries 0xA5 there. That is ra8_gpt.c's `ra8_gtwp_t`
//! (line 55): `k_ra8_gtwp_key_unlock` 0xA500, "password in upper byte,
//! WP=0", and `k_ra8_gtwp_key_lock` 0xA501, the same password with WP=1,
//! citing HUM Ch 22.2.1 "GTWP : General PWM Timer Write Protection Register"
//! p 883..884.
//!
//! The register was shadow storage here, so protection neither locked nor
//! rejected anything and every store landed whatever GTWP held. The HAL is
//! built the other way round: every entry point that touches a channel
//! brackets its work with the two keys. `ra8_gpt_start` (line 291) unlocks,
//! writes GTSTP, GTCR, GTPR, GTCNT and GTSTR, then locks; `ra8_gpt_stop`,
//! `ra8_gpt_period_set`, `ra8_gpt_duty_cycle_set`, `ra8_gpt_capture_source`
//! (line 538), the three-phase pair and the rest do the same, twenty-two
//! bracketed windows in one file. So a channel the HAL has finished with is
//! LOCKED, and a later store that skips the key is one the part drops on the
//! floor. Against the old model such a store took effect, which is the
//! optimistic direction: a driver bug that forgets to unlock ran here and
//! failed on the bench.
//!
//! WHAT THE PROTECTION COVERS HERE: the registers this model interprets, the
//! set the HAL brackets, which is the counter and period, the control and
//! status words, the start / stop / clear requests, the compares and their
//! buffers, and GTBER. GTWP itself is never protected, or nothing could ever
//! unlock it.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: HUM's own list of protected registers.
//! Neither tree carries the table (ra8_gpt_regs.h gives GTWP an offset and
//! no field map, and the key enum is the whole of it), so the shadowed
//! registers this model does not interpret keep taking stores while a
//! channel is locked rather than being swept into a set nobody here has
//! read. And what GTWP reads back: the key is a password, not state, so a
//! read answers the WP bit alone. No driver in either tree ever reads the
//! register, so nothing observes the difference.
