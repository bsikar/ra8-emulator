//! GTBER: the compare a channel takes up at the end of a cycle.
//!
//! GTBER sits at +0x40 (ra8_gpt_regs.h, `R_GPT0.GTBER`, "Buffer Enable").
//! Its CCRA field is bits 16..17 and its CCRB field is bits 18..19, and
//! setting the lower bit of a pair selects single-buffer operation: the value
//! firmware parked in the buffer register moves into the live compare at the
//! end of the counting cycle. That is ra8_gpt.c's `ra8_gpt_buffer_bits_t`
//! (`k_ra8_gpt_gtber_ccra_single` 0x0001_0000, `k_ra8_gpt_gtber_ccrb_single`
//! 0x0004_0000), citing HUM Ch 22.2.17 "GTBER" p 932..935. The buffer that
//! feeds GTCCRA is GTCCR[2] at +0x54 and the one that feeds GTCCRB is
//! GTCCR[3] at +0x58; the driver names them C and E (`ra8_gpt_ccr_idx_t`,
//! HUM Ch 22.2.20 "GTCCRA..F" p 938).
//!
//! The register was shadow storage here and both buffers were among the four
//! compare/capture words gpt_compare.zig deliberately left alone, so nothing
//! carried a parked value across. That is not a small gap: the HAL's only
//! runtime duty setter never touches the live register at all.
//! `ra8_gpt_duty_cycle_set` (ra8_gpt.c line 613) writes the new compare into
//! GTCCR[2] or GTCCR[3] and asserts the matching GTBER bit, and
//! `ra8_gpt_three_phase_set_duty` (line 833) does the same for all three
//! motor channels. Against the old model every one of those calls returned
//! success and changed nothing: GTCCRA kept the duty `ra8_gpt_init` gave it,
//! GTST.TCFA went on matching the old value forever, and a driver ramping a
//! motor read back a compare that never moved. The GPT file's own note said
//! a buffered duty "takes effect at once", which was the optimistic reading;
//! it never took effect.
//!
//! WHERE THE CYCLE ENDS. A saw's cycle ends where it wraps, a one-shot's at
//! the single peak that stops it, and a triangle's when it comes back to
//! zero, which is the whole up-and-down. The part is finer than that: HUM
//! distinguishes crest from trough transfer for the triangle modes, and
//! neither this tree nor ra8-firmware carries that table, so a triangle
//! reloads at the trough here and nothing pretends to know what the crest
//! variants do differently.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: double buffering, which is the upper bit of
//! each GTBER pair, so a pair selecting it gets the single-buffer transfer
//! rather than an invented two-deep queue; GTBER's period and dead-time
//! buffer fields, along with GTPBR (+0x68) and GTPDBR (+0x6C), so a buffered
//! PERIOD still does not arrive; and the buffer-transfer skipping in GTITC,
//! which nothing in either tree programs.
