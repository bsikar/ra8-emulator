//! The debug probe side of SEGGER RTT: find the firmware's control block in
//! RAM, drain its terminal up-buffer, and surface the text.
//!
//! This owns no register window. RTT is a plain-RAM protocol, so the J-Link
//! scans target RAM for the ten-byte ID the block starts with, reads up-buffer
//! zero's ring, and stores the advanced read offset back so the firmware sees
//! the buffer emptying. That is all this file does, once per chunk boundary,
//! against the same SRAM the CPU is running out of. An RTT-logging image gets
//! its banner out of the emulator with no UART pin, exactly as it would in
//! JLinkRTTViewer.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_rtt.c on dev, with four things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! THE RING HAS TO BE IN RAM. dev checks the descriptor's sizes and offsets
//! and never checks where the storage pointer points, then reads through it
//! and stores four bytes of read offset back through it. A block caught
//! half-initialised, with a stale or garbage pointer, has the emulator reading
//! the peripheral window and calling the result firmware output, and writing
//! into an address the firmware never meant as a ring. Here the whole ring and
//! the descriptor must lie inside the mapped SRAM window, and a candidate that
//! does not is refused and counted.
//!
//! A FORGOTTEN BLOCK RE-ARMS THE SCAN. dev forgets a clobbered block by
//! zeroing the address and leaves the scan cadence where it was, which is
//! already in the past, so from then on it scans the whole RAM window on every
//! single tick for the rest of the run. Here forgetting re-arms the backoff.
//!
//! A TORN-DOWN BLOCK IS NOT DRAINED. dev validates the up-buffer count once,
//! at discovery, and never reads it again, so an image that tears its RTT
//! block down keeps being drained through a descriptor it no longer publishes.
//! Re-read every drain here.
//!
//! THE FIRST SCAN IS AT THE FIRST BOUNDARY, not sixty-four chunks in: see
//! `cadence`.
//!
//! THE UNFINISHED LINE SURVIVES, and an over-long one is not counted as a line
//! the firmware ended: see rtt_line.zig.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: down-buffers (host to target input, which
//! nothing in this tree drives), up-buffers past channel zero, and the
//! descriptor's flags word, whose blocking modes only matter to a writer that
//! fills the ring faster than the probe empties it.
