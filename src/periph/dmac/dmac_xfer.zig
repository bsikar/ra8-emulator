//! The DMAC channel plan: what one channel's registers say a request should
//! move, decoded in one place so src/periph/dmac.zig stays a register window
//! and a trigger path. Same split drw.zig/drw_blend.zig and
//! dtc.zig/dtc_xfer.zig have.
//!
//! Unlike the DTC, the DMAC keeps its whole descriptor in its own registers:
//! DMSAR, DMDAR, DMCRA, DMCRB, DMTMD and DMAMD are the transfer, so nothing
//! here reads memory. What a request actually copies is decided by three
//! fields: DMTMD.MD says how much one request is worth, DMTMD.SZ says how
//! wide a unit is, and DMAMD.SM/DM say what happens to each address after a
//! unit goes past.
