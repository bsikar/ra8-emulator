//! DMAC0: the direct memory access controller, which copies a buffer on one
//! register store instead of a loop of loads and stores.
//!
//! Eight channels at 0x4000_A000, 0x40 apart. The shared module bank next
//! door, whose DMAST.DMST is the activation gate over all eight, is its own
//! file (dma_bank.zig) and this block asks it before every request. A channel is programmed with DMSAR, DMDAR, DMCRA, DMCRB, DMTMD
//! and DMAMD, armed with DMCNT.DTE, and triggered with a DMREQ.SWREQ store.
//! Unlike the DTC next door, nothing about the transfer lives in memory: the
//! registers ARE the descriptor, which is why there is no vector table here.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_dmac.c on dev, with four of its behaviours
//! corrected rather than carried over, each named in the decisions below: dev
//! copies the whole count on one request whatever DMREQ.CLRS says, ignores
//! DMAST entirely, leaves DMCNT.DTE up after the count is spent, and treats
//! every address mode that is not increment as fixed.
//!
//! ONE DIVERGENCE OF THIS TREE'S OWN, SAID OUT LOUD: the copy happens inside
//! the SWREQ store, as it does on dev, but the transfer-end interrupt does
//! not: it is queued and raised at the chunk boundary with the rest of the
//! events, so firmware sees the bytes immediately and the interrupt one
//! boundary later.
