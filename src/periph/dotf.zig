//! DOTF: decryption on the fly, so an encrypted-XSPI bring-up finishes.
//!
//! Two channels sit at 0x4026_8800 with a 0x100 stride, one in front of each
//! xSPI controller (ra8_dotf_regs.h ra8_dotf_addr_t, cited there against FSP
//! R_DOTF_Type and HUM Ch 45 p 3048-3050). The block had no model here at
//! all: every access fell through to the sparse register file, which stores
//! whatever it is given and hands it straight back. That gets one thing
//! actively wrong rather than merely thin. `ra8_dotf_self_test` writes
//! REG00 bit 20 and then waits for that same bit to read back CLEAR, so a
//! register that keeps what it was given never ends the test: the driver
//! spins out its budget and reports a hardware timeout on a part that is
//! working. CONVAREAD was wrong in a quieter way, reading back the zeroes
//! that were written into its reserved field where silicon reads ones.
//!
//!   CONVAREAST (+0x000, 32b) conversion area start, 4 KB granular
//!   CONVAREAD  (+0x004, 32b) conversion area end, reserved field reads 1
//!   REG00      (+0x080, 32b) AES enable, key size, mode, self-test
//!   REG03      (+0x08C, 32b) key and IV staging window, write-only
//!
//! The address rule is in src/periph/dotf_region.zig and the REG00 rule in
//! src/periph/dotf_control.zig, each of which states what it does not model.
//!
//! REG03 IS A STAGING WINDOW, NOT A REGISTER. The driver pushes four words
//! of IV, or four to eight words of wrapped key, big-endian, one after the
//! other into the same address (ra8_dotf.c internal_stage_iv and
//! internal_stage_key). Nothing reads it back, and there is no read value in
//! either tree, so a read answers zero and a write is counted rather than
//! stored. Every other offset in the window is reserved padding in FSP's own
//! struct; it is shadowed so a read-modify-write survives, and never read.
