//! The cellular AT modem on the MikroBUS UART, and the difference between a
//! command the modem heard and a line the model answered anyway.
//!
//! SCI7 (RXD7/TXD7) is the MikroBUS UART on the EK-RA8D2, and `ra8_modem_at`
//! clocks a command out of it one TDR store at a time. This is a line state
//! machine on that channel, not a bus block: it hangs off the SCI device seam
//! the same way the SD card and the e-paper panel hang off the SPI one, so
//! the firmware's genuine polled `ra8_sci_getc_polling` path drains the reply
//! out of RDR exactly as it would on the bench. Ported from
//! board_periph_modem.c on dev, with two things that model does not do.
//!
//! AN OVER-LONG LINE IS NOT A COMMAND. dev buffers 63 bytes and silently
//! throws the rest away, then answers whatever prefix it kept as though that
//! were the command the driver sent. Here the overflow marks the line, the
//! answer is the CME error, and the run is told a line was too long: a
//! command that never fit is a driver bug the bench would show.
//!
//! THE MATCH IS V.250's, NOT A BYTE COMPARE: see modem_script.zig.
//!
//! The seam also carries a rule this model gets for free and dev did not
//! have: a byte only reaches the line when CCR0.TE is set, and a reply only
//! reaches the firmware when CCR0.RE is (src/periph/sci.zig).
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: command echo (a real part powers up with
//! ATE1 and the script's own ATE0 turns it off, but nothing in this tree says
//! how the driver treats an echoed line, so dev's echo-free wire is kept),
//! the DTR and RI pins, and any timing between the command and its answer.
