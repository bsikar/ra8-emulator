//! What to do about a card the formatter refused.
//!
//! The error name alone sends a reader to the source to learn that a FAT32
//! volume needs 65525 clusters before it is allowed to call itself one, and
//! that at 512 bytes a cluster that is more card than the 32 MB this model
//! comes up with. So the refusal names a size that would have worked, and
//! the other width when that fits the card in hand.
//!
//! The sizes are computed by the same solver that did the refusing, so they
//! cannot drift away from it, and they are whole megabytes, which is both
//! what the command line takes and a whole number of the 512 KiB units a
//! CSD counts in, so a size named here is always one the card can be
//! resized to.
