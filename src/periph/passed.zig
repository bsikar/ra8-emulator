//! Pends that were ready, lost the pick, and stayed pending.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. src/periph/nvic.zig's `pick` walks everything pending and
//! returns the most urgent one. The others are dropped on the floor: no
//! counter moved, no line printed, and from the report they were never ready
//! at all. src/periph/held.zig does NOT cover them. `held.outranked` is a
//! different question, whether a RUNNING handler outranks the winner, and on
//! `threadx_blink` it fires twice in a thousand modelled milliseconds while
//! the thing actually going wrong happens constantly.
//!
//! WHAT IT WAS BUILT FOR. `threadx_blink` runs its thread body about three
//! times per wake where the board runs it once. ThreadX writes SHPR3 to
//! 0x40FF0000, so SysTick sits at priority 0x40 and PendSV at 0xFF, and
//! SysTick is pending at very nearly every boundary. Any PendSV the scheduler
//! raises therefore loses the pick, every time, and nothing said so: the run
//! reported 999 SysTick entries, 4 PendSV entries, 16 held, and no sign that
//! a PendSV had been standing there all along. That is the shape this counts.
//!
//! A loss is NOT a bug on its own. Losing one pick is the architecture
//! working: the winner runs and the loser is taken next, which is what
//! tail-chaining in src/core/run_loop.zig is for. What matters is a pend that
//! loses CONSECUTIVE boundaries, so the run of losses is tracked as well as
//! the count.
