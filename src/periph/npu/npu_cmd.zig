//! is the small documented stand-in from inc/ra8_npu_fake_cmd.h on dev: five
//! words, a marker in the top half of the first one, an opcode in its bottom
//! half, then a source region, a destination region, a byte count and a
//! constant. A real Vela program carries none of that, which is exactly how
//! this model tells the two apart.
//!
//! The decode lives here rather than in npu.zig so the register window stays
//! a register window, the same split dmac.zig/dmac_xfer.zig and
//! sdhi.zig/sdhi_xfer.zig have.
