//! The NPU model's path for a stream that is not the stand-in: read it from
//! QBASE, hand it to the Vela runner, and latch what happened in STATUS.
//!
//! npu.zig decodes the stand-in program and calls `kick` only when the
//! stream lacks the stand-in's marker, so the stand-in path and every image
//! that uses it are untouched. Results follow the same rules as the
//! stand-in: a completed program sets cmd_end and the interrupt; a stream
//! that cannot be read is a bus error; a stream that is malformed, or that
//! needs an operator this model does not run yet, is a parse fault. Every
//! fault raises the interrupt too, and cmd_end stays clear.
