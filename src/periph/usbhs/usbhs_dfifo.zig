//! The two data FIFO ports, D0FIFO and D1FIFO: which pipe each is aimed at,

//! dev did not model these at all. Every offset in the pair fell through to
//! the register shadow, so a driver that moved bulk payload the way the
//! hardware manual says to move it wrote its packet into a shadow word and
//! read the same word back as the packet the device had answered with. The
//! transfer looked perfect and nothing ever reached the far end.
//!
//! A data port is not CFIFO at a different offset. There is no ISEL here: the
//! direction is the one PIPECFG gave the pipe. MBW says how wide an access the
//! port answers, and the DCP is not reachable from one at all.
