//! The controller's power and port side: whether it is on, whose role it is
//! playing, and what the port reset settled on.
//!
//! dev answered the host's registers whatever SYSCFG said, and reported the
//! PHY PLL locked from the first read, so an image that never turned the
//! module or its clock on enumerated a device in the emulator and did nothing
//! on the bench. The machine here has to be brought up the way silicon is.
//!
//! The PHY behind the switch is not here: PHYSET, LPSTS and the PLL lock
//! they earn live in usbhs_pll.zig. The split is the driver's own, because
//! the PHY comes up before SYSCFG.USBE does.
//!
//! A LINE STATE IS EARNED, NOT ASSUMED. Being powered and having something
//! plugged in is not enough for the host to SEE it, and the driver's own
//! bring-up says so twice, in the two comments that name the two bits:
//!
//!   SYSCFG.CNEN, the single-ended receiver (ra8_usb_irq.c, internal_host_
//!   hs_bringup): "CNEN (single-ended receiver enable) is required for the
//!   HS PHY to report line state / attach at all -- without it LNST reads
//!   SE0 forever and no ATTCH ever latches (HUM Ch 37.2.1 p 2062)."
//!
//!   DVSTCTR0.VBUSEN, the jack's external VBUS switch (same file, the HS
//!   branch of the host init): "the USBHS jack's external VBUS switch is
//!   driven by this bit (FSP hw_usb_hmodule_init); without it an attached
//!   device never powers and LNST stays SE0."
//!
//! Neither bit was named anywhere in this tree, so LNST answered J-state
//! from the moment the module was on with something attached. That is the
//! wrong direction to be wrong in: ra8_usb_hmsc_enum's attach hunt breaks
//! out of its 50-million-iteration spin the instant line_state is non-zero,
//! so a host image that forgot either bit enumerated a device here and sat
//! through the whole spin and its timeout on the bench. Both are gates on
//! the same answer now, and a reset cannot settle a speed the port could
//! not have observed either.
//!
//! THE DEVICE SIDE HAS ITS OWN TWO GATES, and they are not the same pair.
//! The previous slice left them out as NOT MODELLED because nothing found
//! then described them; ra8_usb_device.c does, at length, so they are in:
//!
//!   SYSCFG.CNEN again, quoting HUM Ch 37.2.1 p 2062 directly: "In device
//!   controller mode, set this bit to 1 when VBUS is detected because of a
//!   VBUS interrupt, and set it to 0 when the VBUS line is removed."
//!   Without it "the HS PHY's single-end receivers are powered down and
//!   SYSSTS0.LNST[1:0] reads 00b (SE0) regardless of what the host's
//!   pull-down arrangement and the device's DPRPU pull-up are doing on the
//!   wires."
//!
//!   SYSCFG.DPRPU, the device's own 1.5k pull-up on D+. It is what puts the
//!   line in J-state in the first place, and ra8_usb_device_attach writes
//!   CNEN BEFORE it "so the receivers latch the line state the moment DPRPU
//!   pulls D+ high" (HUM Ch 37.3.3 Figure 37.2 p 2121).
//!
//! So: host role needs CNEN and VBUSEN, device role needs CNEN and DPRPU,
//! and the one bit both roles share is the receiver. VBUSEN stays out of
//! the device path because a device does not own the jack's switch, and
//! DPRPU stays out of the host path for the mirror reason.
//!
//! STILL NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the FS instance has no CNEN gate at
//! all (ra8_usb_device.c, citing HUM Ch 36.2.1 p 1966), so on a part with
//! the FS controller these gates are one bit too many. This model is the HS
//! instance and has no FS one, so there is nothing to branch on yet.
