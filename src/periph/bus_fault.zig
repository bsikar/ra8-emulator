//! Raising a BusFault for an access the bus refused.
//!
//! A load or store the bus cannot complete is a precise data BusFault:
//! BFSR.PRECISERR, with BFARVALID and BFAR holding the address it went for.
//! A refused instruction fetch is IBUSERR and leaves BFAR alone, because the
//! faulting PC already says where (DDI0553 D1.2.11, D1.2.6). The fault is
//! then taken like any configurable one: its own vector while
//! SHCSR.BUSFAULTENA stands and it can preempt what is running, HardFault
//! with HFSR.FORCED otherwise. src/periph/fault_route.zig decides which.
//!
//! A precise fault stacks the faulting instruction as the return address, so
//! a handler that fixes the cause and returns retries the access.
//!
