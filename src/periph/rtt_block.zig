//! The SEGGER RTT control block, as a debug probe reads it out of target RAM.
//!
//! RTT is not a peripheral: it is a ring buffer the firmware puts in RAM and a
//! J-Link drains over SWD. The probe finds it by scanning target RAM for the
//! ten-byte ID the block begins with, then reads the up-buffer descriptors
//! that follow. This file is that vocabulary, and the sanity checks that
//! decide whether a candidate is a live block or ten bytes that happened to
//! spell the ID; the scanning and draining live in rtt.zig.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_rtt.c on dev, with one check dev does not make:
//! the ring has to be in RAM. See `Window`.
