//! Something listening on an SCI channel's line, and when it is listening.
//!
//! A device is handed each byte the channel actually sends and answers with
//! the bytes it drives back, which the channel queues for the firmware to
//! read out of RDR. One device per channel: the AT modem sits on SCI7 this
//! way (src/periph/modem.zig), the microSD card on SCI0 (src/periph/
//! sd_card_line.zig), and the SPI_B channels use the same shape for the
//! e-ink panel.
//!
//! `spi_only` IS A PIN FACT, NOT A PROTOCOL ONE. A channel's pins are muxed:
//! the Pmod2 slot's SCK / CIPO / COPI / CS reach SCI0 only while the firmware
//! has routed them there and put the channel in Simple-SPI mode, and a
//! channel driven as a UART is talking to whatever is on the UART pins
//! instead. A card that answered an asynchronous channel would be a card
//! nothing on the board is wired to. The modem is the other way round: it is
//! on a UART line, so it leaves this false and hears everything sent.
