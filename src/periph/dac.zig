//! DAC_B: the two 12-bit D/A channels, and the enable bit that decides
//! whether a code written to one of them is an output at all.
//!
//! DAC_B0 sits at 0x4023_3000 and DAC_B1 0x100 above it (ra8_dac_b_regs.h,
//! FSP R_DAC_B0_Type). Each channel is a {DADR, DACR0, DACR1, DACR2} set, and
//! the part has no conversion-result readback: a driver writes a 12-bit code
//! to DADR and that is the whole output path. So what firmware can observe
//! here is its own control state read back, and what a headless run can
//! observe is the code stream itself.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_dac.c on dev, with four things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! A NARROW WRITE ONLY TOUCHES THE BYTES IT NAMES. dev ignores the access
//! size and drops the whole 32-bit value into the word, so a byte store to
//! DACR0.DACEN, which is how `ra8_dac_b_set_output_enable` flips the channel
//! on without disturbing the rest of the register, wipes the bytes above it.
//!
//! DADR IS TWELVE BITS WIDE, NOT THIRTY-TWO. dev latches the raw value and
//! reads it straight back, so an image that stores 0xF123 reads 0xF123 and
//! believes bits silicon does not have. Here the stored code is masked to the
//! data field, so a read-back is the code the channel would actually convert.
//!
//! A CODE WRITTEN TO A DISABLED CHANNEL IS NOT AN OUTPUT. dev counts every
//! DADR store into the same last/peak/writes trio whatever DACR0.DACEN says,
//! so a run that never enabled the channel still reports a waveform it never
//! drove. Here a store with DACEN clear is counted separately as `dark`, and
//! the report says so, because an image whose enable never took is exactly
//! the failure the count was supposed to catch.
//!
//! A DISABLED OUTPUT CONVERTS NOTHING, ENABLE OR NO ENABLE. DACR0.DAOUTDIS
//! is how a driver opened without the internal route, and how the block's own
//! deinit, shuts a channel; a code stored to one is staged, not driven. The
//! placement of those twelve bits inside DADR is DACR1.DPSEL's call, not a
//! fixed low-twelve. Both live in src/periph/dac_output.zig, which carries
//! the bit map and what is deliberately left alone in it.
//!
//! THE HALFWORD ABOVE DADR IS NOT DADR. The register is sixteen bits wide at
//! +0x00 and the sixteen bits above it are the reserved gap FSP carries as
//! `reserved_dadr` and ra8_dac_b_regs.h marks "RESERVED (must read as 0)".
//! Every access landing in that upper half used to run the DADR prong, so a
//! store there was taken for a code: it walked the enable gate and bumped
//! `outputs`, `dark` or `blocked` and could move `peak`, reporting a waveform
//! the firmware never wrote. It cannot move the code itself (the merge lands
//! above the sixteen bits DADR keeps), so the register readback was right all
//! along and only the count was wrong. Now the gap reads zero the way the
//! header says and a store to it latches nothing, counted in `above_data`.
//! An access that STARTS in DADR still carries, whatever its width: a word
//! store at +0x00 is the whole pair and its upper half is dropped, and the
//! driver's own single 16-bit store to DADR (ra8_dac_b.c:182) is untouched.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: DACR0.DAE and DACR2.OFSSEL, for the reasons
//! that file gives. The rest of the window is shadowed so a read-modify-write
//! survives, and never read.
