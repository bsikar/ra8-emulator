//! One R-Switch port: the ETHA agent's mode machine and the RMAC's MDIO
//! window onto the PHY behind it.
//!
//! A port is two register windows a thousand bytes apart, so it hands the bus
//! two blocks rather than claiming the gap between them. Everything else in
//! the port's two kilobytes is configuration the driver writes and reads back,
//! which the bus already does for an address nothing models.
//!
//! Every register here is 32 bits, so an access narrower than a word is the
//! `lanes.zig` rule: a read is served from the word the address lands in and
//! then cut, and a store is merged into that word so the lanes it does not
//! name keep what they had.
//!
//! BOTH WINDOWS ARE DARK UNTIL THE ESWM POWER DOMAIN IS ON. The R-Switch sits
//! in its own switchable domain, gated off at reset behind PDCTRESWM, so this
//! port asks src/periph/pdctr.zig before it answers anything. ra8_cgc_eswclk.c
//! states the hardware behaviour outright: "every per-port RMAC / ETHA
//! register read returns 0 and writes are silently dropped until
//! PDCTRESWM.PDDE = 0", marked as observed on EK-RA8D2 hardware. Without the
//! question a firmware that never powered the domain drives a whole port here,
//! walks its mode machine up to OPERATION and reads its own MAC address back,
//! and does none of it on the bench. The read answering zero is the half that
//! bites hardest: the mode machine reads DISABLE forever, so a driver polling
//! for CONFIG spins rather than failing.
//!
//! A port with no domain attached is ungated, which is what a test about the
//! mode machine or the MDIO bus wants; src/board/net.zig wires the real one in
//! when it puts the cluster on the bus.
