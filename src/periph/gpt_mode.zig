//! GTCR.MD: the shape a GPT channel counts in.
//!
//! GTCR (+0x2C) carries MD at bits 16..19 (ra8_gpt.c `ra8_gpt_gtcr_bits_t`,
//! `k_ra8_gpt_gtcr_md_shift = 16`, citing HUM Ch 22.2.5 "GTCR : General PWM
//! Timer Control Register" p 904..906). `ra8_gpt_mode_t` in ra8_gpt.h names
//! five encodings and no others:
//!
//!   0  saw-wave PWM, up-count
//!   1  saw-wave one-shot
//!   4  triangle-wave PWM, symmetric
//!   5  triangle-wave PWM 1
//!   6  triangle-wave PWM 2
//!
//! The field was stored and never read, so every channel counted up and
//! wrapped whatever its driver selected. `ra8_gpt_init` writes the mode on
//! every channel it brings up (line 345, `internal_gtcr(cfg->mode, ...)`) and
//! `ra8_gpt_three_phase_init` hands the same one to all three motor channels,
//! so a triangle channel sawed: a driver sampling GTCNT to find which half of
//! the cycle it was in read a ramp that only ever rose, and a one-shot
//! channel kept counting forever instead of stopping at the period. dev's
//! board_periph_timer.c has the same hole.
//!
//! A TRIANGLE COUNTS UP AND BACK DOWN. The cycle is twice the period: the
//! count rises to GTPR, turns, falls to zero, and turns again. Reaching the
//! period is the overflow (GTST.TCFPO) and returning to zero is the underflow
//! (GTST.TCFPU), which is the bit dev names and nothing in this tree could
//! raise before. A chunk of counting wider than the cycle folds, so the
//! direction after it is where the fold landed, not where it started.
//!
//! A ONE-SHOT STOPS AT THE PERIOD. It counts up once, raises the overflow,
//! and clears GTCR.CST, so the count stands at GTPR and a driver polling for
//! the stop sees it. That is the model's reading of "one-shot": the part also
//! holds the output at its final level, and there is no output here.
//!
//! A MODE SELECTED IS NOT A MODE COUNTED IN. MD is stored in GTCR beside
//! CST, so a driver that writes the whole control word to start a channel
//! also rewrites the shape, and nothing said so. `ra8_gpt_start_free_run`
//! does exactly that: it writes `GTCR = 0x00000001`, which is CST with MD
//! zero, so a channel `ra8_gpt_init` had configured as a one-shot counts as
//! saw PWM from the first start onward and never stops at its period. The
//! one-shot demo reaches this: it arms MD = 1, then starts, and the run
//! reported an ordinary free-running saw with nothing to say the shape it
//! asked for had been taken away. `Log` below remembers the first shape MD
//! was ever moved to and how many times it moved, so the report can name
//! both the shape a channel asked for and the one it actually counted in.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: what separates the three triangle
//! encodings. ra8_gpt.h names 4, 5 and 6 as "symmetric", "PWM 1" and "PWM 2",
//! and neither tree says how their duty loading differs; they count the same
//! triangle here, which is the part of the difference GTCNT can show. The
//! encodings nobody names (2, 3 and 7..15) count in saw mode rather than
//! being given an invented shape, and `name()` says the mode is unknown so
//! the run does not claim to have recognised it.
