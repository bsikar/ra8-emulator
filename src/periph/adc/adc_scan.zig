//! What one A/D scan slot converts to: which group the slot belongs to, which
//! physical source it names, and the code that source reports.
//!
//! The register window next door in adc.zig owns the addresses and the scan
//! machine; this file owns the arithmetic, so neither has to carry the other.
//! Every function here is pure: give it a register word and it tells you what
//! the converter would answer.
//!
//! There is no analog core behind any of this. A mid-scale input is the only
//! honest thing to report for a pin nothing drives, and the self-diagnosis
//! codes are the IDEAL result for the armed mode, which is to say a healthy
//! SAR. A stuck converter cannot be injected here and stays a bench test.
