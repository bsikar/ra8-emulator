//! ACMPHS: the high-speed analog comparators, so a comparator poll ends.
//!
//! Six channels live at 0x4023_6000 with a 0x100 stride (ra8_acmphs_regs.h,
//! k_ra8_acmphs0_base_addr / k_ra8_acmphs_channel_count / _stride, cited
//! there against FSP R_ACMPHS0_BASE and HUM Ch 56). The block had no model
//! here at all: every access fell through to the sparse register file, which
//! stores whatever it is given and hands it back, so CMPMON was a byte
//! firmware could write and then read its own value out of, and a channel
//! that was never enabled monitored exactly as much as one that was.
//!
//!   CMPCTL   (+0x00, 8b)  CINV, COE, CSTEN, CEG[1:0], CDFS[1:0], HCMPON
//!   CMPSEL0  (+0x04, 8b)  plus-input selection
//!   CMPSEL1  (+0x08, 8b)  minus-input (reference) selection
//!   CMPMON   (+0x0C, 8b)  output monitor, read-only, derived here
//!   CPIOC    (+0x10, 8b)  output polarity / pin control
//!   CPINTCTL (+0x40, 8b)  interrupt control
//!   CPMSKCTL (+0x44, 8b)  interrupt mask control
//!
//! CMPMON IS READ-ONLY AND DERIVED. The sparse file let a store land in it;
//! here the store is refused and counted, the same line the RTC file draws
//! around R64CNT. What it reads comes from src/periph/acmphs_output.zig,
//! which carries the monitor rule and states what it does not model.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the ACMPHS interrupt. CPINTCTL and
//! CPMSKCTL gate an event whose ELC number nothing in this tree carries, so
//! they are stored and read back and raise nothing. Every offset in the
//! channel window besides the seven named above is shadowed so a
//! read-modify-write survives, and never interpreted.
