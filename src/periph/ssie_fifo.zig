//! The SSIE transmit staging FIFO: how many samples it holds, what SSIFSR
//! reports about that, and what a reset does to it.
//!
//! Split out of src/periph/ssie.zig, which models the handshake and the
//! sample stream. This file owns the part a driver uses for flow control.
//!
//! THE DEPTH IS THE PART'S, NOT A NUMBER THIS MODEL PICKED. ra8_ssie_regs.h
//! on ra8-firmware's zig/dev carries `k_ra8_ssie_fifo_depth = 32`, a 32-stage
//! FIFO per direction (HUM Ch 46.2.4 p 3083). The old model staged eight and
//! said so in its own header, so a driver priming a full FIFO lost three
//! quarters of what it wrote.
//!
//! SSIFSR CARRIES THE COUNT, NOT JUST THE EMPTY FLAG. TDC[5:0] sits at bits
//! 29..24 and RDC[5:0] at 13..8 (ra8_ssie_regs.h k_ra8_ssie_mask_tdc /
//! k_ra8_ssie_shift_tdc). That field is what `ra8_ssie_write_buffer` reads
//! before every store: it breaks out of its loop the moment TDC reaches the
//! depth, so a model answering a flat zero tells the driver there is room
//! forever and the samples past the last stage go on the floor while the
//! driver reports them written.
//!
//! A RESET EMPTIES IT. SSIFCR's RFRST (bit 0) and TFRST (bit 1) are the FIFO
//! resets (HUM Ch 46.2.3 p 3077). `internal_pulse_fifo_reset` in ra8_ssie.c
//! asserts both and clears them again on every start, so a channel restarted
//! after a reconfiguration begins with an empty FIFO rather than draining
//! samples staged for the setup it just replaced.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: holding a reset bit asserted. Neither tree
//! says whether a FIFO stays clamped while RFRST or TFRST reads 1, and the
//! driver only ever pulses them, so the flush happens on the write that
//! asserts the bit and the bit is then just a bit. Nor are the bits
//! self-clearing here: the driver writes them back to zero itself, and
//! nothing in either tree says the hardware would have.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED EITHER: RDC. There is no receive source in this model, so the
//! count is always zero; the field is named here so the read path packs it in
//! the right place when one arrives, not because a value is being invented.
