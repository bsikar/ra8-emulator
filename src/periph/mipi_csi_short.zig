//! The generic short-packet FIFO rule for MIPI CSI-2: what GSCT asks for,
//! what GSST answers, and what GSIU does to it.
//!
//! This is decode only. The block in mipi_csi.zig owns the FIFO itself and
//! the counters; everything here is a pure function of the words, so the
//! clear handshake can be stated once and tested on its own.
//!
//! Field positions are from ra8-firmware libs/ra8_hal/inc/ra8_mipi_csi_regs.h
//! on zig/dev, which cites HUM Ch 66.3.24-66.3.29 pp 3956-3960.
