//! CEU: the parallel-camera capture engine, and the frame it actually wrote.
//!
//! The RA8D2 Capture Engine Unit sits at 0x4034_8000 (HUM Ch 60, the parallel
//! camera path ra8_ceu.c drives). The firmware's `camera_capture` example
//! programs the geometry, points CDAYR at a frame buffer, arms a single shot
//! by setting CAPSR.CE, then polls CETCR.CPE for one-frame-end. On silicon
//! that end comes from the sensor's VD edge; there is no sensor here, so the
//! capture happens inside the CE write and a deterministic diagonal gradient,
//! (x + y) & 0xFF, stands in for the pixels. That is enough for the app to
//! run its capture -> stats -> verdict path with a non-degenerate min, max
//! and mean. It is not a claim the silicon captured anything: the board's
//! J1/TFT VIO_HD conflict (issue #119) is outside what any model can see.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_ceu.c on dev, with four things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! CETCR IS WHAT THE ENGINE RAISED, NOT A REGISTER FIRMWARE FILLS IN. dev
//! drops any store straight into the register, so an image writes CETCR = 1
//! and reads back a completed frame having never armed a capture, which is
//! the whole claim the camera demo exists to make. Here a store may only
//! clear a flag that is set, which is how the real event register behaves;
//! a store that would raise one is refused and counted, the way SRAMESR and
//! POEG's PIDF are.
//!
//! THE DESTINATION STRIDE IS NOT THE CAPTURE WIDTH. dev takes CDWDR as the
//! number of bytes to write per line and fills all of them, so a frame
//! buffer whose lines are padded (stride wider than the image) comes back
//! with the gradient painted over the padding. Here CAPWR.HWDTH is how many
//! bytes a line carries and CDWDR is only how far the next line starts, so
//! the padding is left exactly as the firmware left it.
//!
//! A GEOMETRY TOO BIG TO MODEL IS REFUSED, NOT QUIETLY SHRUNK. dev clamps a
//! line to 8192 bytes and a frame to 4096 lines and captures anyway, so an
//! image that programmed the geometry wrongly still gets CPE and reads its
//! stats out of a frame smaller than the one it asked for. Here the arm is
//! declined and no event is raised.
//!
//! A WRITE THE MEMORY REFUSES IS A FAILED CAPTURE. dev ignores the result of
//! every guest write, so a CDAYR pointing at nothing mapped still latches
//! CPE and still counts a frame. Here the capture is abandoned at the first
//! refused line and CPE stays clear.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: everything CETCR carries besides CPE (the
//! field, overflow and CHDW events), the capture-format and clipping
//! registers, and the Plane-B address path. No header for this part is in
//! this tree to say what their bits mean, so they are shadowed, so that a
//! read-modify-write of them survives, and never interpreted. CSTSR reads
//! idle because the capture is instantaneous, and CAPSR.CPKIL self-clears
//! for the same reason.
