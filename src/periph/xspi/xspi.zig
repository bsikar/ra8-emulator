//! XSPI0: the manual-command engine in front of the octal NOR flash, and the
//! write-enable latch that decides whether a command is allowed to change
//! the part.
//!
//! The window sits at 0x4026_8000 (ra8_ospi_regs.h). The driver's sequence
//! is the same one the real part wants: fill the slot-0 command descriptor
//! in CDBUF (CDT, address, then two data words), set CDCTL0.TRREQ, poll
//! INTS.CMDCMP, clear it through INTC, and read the data words back. This
//! model decodes the descriptor, runs the opcode against the NOR array in
//! xspi_flash.zig, raises CMDCMP and drops TRREQ.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_xspi.c on dev, with four things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! WRITE ENABLE IS A LATCH, NOT A DECORATION. dev answers RDSR with WEL
//! permanently set and programs or erases whatever the descriptor asks,
//! WREN or no WREN. A driver that forgets the write-enable therefore works
//! here and fails on silicon, which is the worst direction for a model to be
//! wrong in. Here WREN sets the latch, a program or erase without it is
//! refused and counted, a completed program or erase clears it again, and
//! RDSR reports the latch the model is actually holding.
//!
//! A DESCRIPTOR CANNOT ASK FOR MORE THAN THE SLOT HOLDS. DATASIZE is four
//! bits, so it can name up to fifteen bytes, and slot 0 has two data words:
//! eight. dev shifts the ninth byte by thirty-two inside a 32-bit word,
//! which is undefined in C and in practice quietly folds back onto the
//! first. Here a descriptor past eight bytes is refused and counted, and so
//! is one whose address and length run off the end of the part rather than
//! being skipped a byte at a time.
//!
//! INTS IS WHAT THE ENGINE RAISED. dev drops any store into the window
//! shadow, INTS included, so an image can write CMDCMP itself and read back
//! a command that completed without a command ever running. Here a store to
//! INTS is refused and counted, the way this tree already treats CETCR and
//! SRAMESR, and INTC stays the only way the flag goes down.
//!
//! NARROW WRITES KEEP THE BYTES THEY DO NOT NAME. dev assigns the whole
//! value into regs[off / 4], so a byte store to CDCTL0 wipes CSSEL above it
//! and the transfer goes to the wrong chip select.
//!
//! A PAGE PROGRAM STAYS IN ITS PAGE. dev walks the address straight up from
//! the one the descriptor names, so a program that starts near the end of a
//! 256-byte page spills its tail into the NEXT page. The part does not do
//! that: the program counter is page-wide, so the tail wraps to the start of
//! the page it began in and overwrites what the same command just wrote. A
//! driver that gets this wrong sees the right bytes here and the wrong ones
//! on silicon, in the direction a model must never be wrong in. Here the
//! program wraps, and a command that wrapped is counted so the run says so.
//! A READ IS NOT PAGED and still streams straight on across pages and
//! sectors, which is why only the program path carries the arithmetic.
//! It follows that a page program cannot run off the end of the part at all:
//! only a start address already past the end is out of the part, which is
//! the same test the erase path uses.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the memory-mapped read path (CSa space),
//! WRAPCFG and the timing and calibration registers, the second command
//! slot, INTE's masks, and every status bit besides CMDCMP. No header for
//! this part is in this tree to give them. The rest of the window is
//! shadowed so a read-modify-write survives, and never interpreted. WIP
//! reads clear because a command completes inside the store that kicked it:
//! there is no time in this model for the part to still be busy.
