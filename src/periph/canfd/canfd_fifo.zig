//! The receive FIFO behind a CAN-FD channel: the frames delivered to it, in
//! the order they arrived, and nothing once they have been taken.
//!
//! A CFDRF window is one frame's worth of registers, but the hardware behind
//! it is a queue: the controller fills stages while the firmware is busy, and
//! CFDRFPCTR advances to the next one. Holding that queue here rather than a
//! single slot is what makes an overrun visible instead of silent, and what
//! makes a pop of an empty FIFO something the model can refuse.
//!
//! Ported out of board_periph_canfd.c on dev, which keeps one slot: a second
//! delivery overwrites the first, so an image that transmits twice before
//! reading loses the older frame with nothing said about it.
