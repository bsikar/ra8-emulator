//! CFDRFSTS: what the receive FIFO tells the firmware about itself, and the
//! one bit in it the firmware is allowed to lower.
//!
//! The register sits at +0x044 per FIFO (`ra8_canfd_regs.h`, CFDRFSTS[2]) and
//! carries four flags:
//!
//!     RFEMP  b0  the FIFO holds nothing
//!     RFFLL  b1  the FIFO holds all it can
//!     RFMLT  b2  a frame arrived with no stage free and was lost
//!     RFIF   b3  a frame is waiting
//!
//! ONLY TWO OF THE FOUR WERE ANSWERED. The block computed RFEMP and RFIF off
//! the queue and left RFFLL and RFMLT at zero forever, so the two flags that
//! report trouble were the two that never appeared. A firmware watching RFFLL
//! to stop offering frames saw room that was not there, and one watching
//! RFMLT to find out it had overrun was told it never had.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical on this corpus. `threadx_canfd_demo` transmits
//! 21 frames into a four-stage FIFO faster than its reader drains it, and 17
//! of them were dropped on the floor with the register reading a placid
//! "a frame is waiting" the whole way through. The end-of-run report knew
//! (`17 frame(s) LOST, no receive stage free`), and the firmware, which is the
//! one that could have done something about it, did not.
//!
//! RFEMP AND RFFLL ARE LIVE STATUS, derived from the queue every read the way
//! RFEMP already was. Neither latches and neither is clearable: the FIFO is
//! full or it is not, and a store cannot argue with it.
//!
//! RFMLT IS A LATCH, because the event it reports is over by the time anyone
//! reads it. It goes up when a delivery finds no stage free and stays up until
//! the firmware lowers it.
//!
//! THE CLEAR IS WRITE-ZERO-TO-CLEAR, by this block's own convention rather
//! than a page read for RFMLT itself, and that distinction is worth stating.
//! No header in this tree gives RFMLT's clear protocol. What this tree does
//! have is the same chapter's rule for the sibling status register, quoted in
//! `ra8_canfd.c` and modelled in `canfd_error.zig`:
//!
//!     /* HUM Ch 41 p 2772 "CFDCnERFL" -- error flags are W0C: writing 0
//!      * clears, writing 1 leaves untouched. */
//!
//! So a store here can lower RFMLT and can never raise it, and a store that
//! carries a one at a flag the controller owns is counted rather than obeyed.
//! Following the block's documented convention beats both alternatives: a
//! flag that never clears would strand a driver that acks correctly, and a
//! W1C guess would let a driver's own acknowledgement invent an overrun.
