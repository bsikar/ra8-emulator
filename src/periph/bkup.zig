//! VBATT backup: the reset-retained register file, and the writes PRCR drops.
//!
//! The RA8D2 keeps 128 battery-backed bytes (VBTBKR0..127) in the R_SYSTEM
//! block at 0x4001_ED00, reachable through the VBATT window that starts at
//! VBTBER (0x4001_EC40). On silicon they keep their contents across a reset,
//! which is the contract a survival demo checks. Ported from
//! board_periph_bkup.c on dev.
//!
//!   VBTBER   (+0x000, 8b)  access enable, VBAE at bit 3, reset value 0x08
//!   VBTBKR0  (+0x0C0, 8b)  first of 128 byte-wide backup slots
//!
//! Two silicon preconditions gate a write here and both are modelled:
//!
//!   1. PRCR.PRC1 unlocked. Every register in the VBATT file is named under
//!      PRC1 (HUM Ch 13.1 Table 13.1 p 521). A write with PRC1 locked is
//!      discarded silently. That is the #131 root cause, bench-confirmed by
//!      J-Link: VBTBKR0 written with PRCR locked reads back 0x0000_0000, and
//!      after PRCR = 0xA502 the identical write sticks.
//!   2. VBTBER.VBAE set (HUM Ch 12.2.6 p 504, "You must write 1 to VBAE before
//!      accessing VBTBKR"). VBAE is already 1 out of reset, which is exactly
//!      why modelling only VBAE left the emulator green while the bench was
//!      red.
//!
//! Reads are never gated: PRCR gates writes only (HUM Ch 13.1 p 520), so a
//! dropped write shows up as a read-back of the old value rather than a fault.
