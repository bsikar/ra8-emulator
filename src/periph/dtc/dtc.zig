//! DTC: the data transfer controller, which moves bytes on an interrupt
//! without waking the CPU.
//!
//! The DTC is not triggered by a register write the way the DMAC is. It is
//! activated by an INTERRUPT: an ICU slot whose IELSR.DTCE bit is set hands
//! its event to the controller instead of straight to the core, the
//! controller reads the descriptor that slot points at, moves what it says,
//! and only lets the CPU see the interrupt once the descriptor has run out.
//! That is why this block is the first consumer of the DTCE bit
//! src/periph/icu.zig has been carrying with nothing reading it.
//!
//!   DTCCR  (+0x00, 8b)  RRS, the read-skip bit (src/periph/dtc_skip.zig)
//!   DTCVBR (+0x04, 32b) the vector table: one TI pointer per ICU slot
//!   DTCST  (+0x0C, 8b)  DTCST b0, the module start bit
//!   DTCSTS (+0x0E, 16b) ACT b15 and the vector number of the last transfer
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_dtc.c on dev, with three of its behaviours
//! corrected rather than carried over, each named in the decisions below: dev
//! moves the whole descriptor on one activation, ignores DTCST entirely, and
//! never writes the descriptor back.
//!
//! ONE DIVERGENCE OF THIS TREE'S OWN, SAID OUT LOUD: the transfer happens at
//! the chunk boundary, where the board drains the events, not inside the
//! store that fired the event. dev performs the copy inside the ELSEGR write,
//! so a firmware there can read the destination in the next instruction; here
//! it has to wait, the way it would wait on any transfer. Silicon steals a
//! bus cycle and is done long before either, so a driver that polls is right
//! on all three and a driver that reads straight through is only right on dev.
