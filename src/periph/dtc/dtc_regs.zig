//! What each byte of the DTC window belongs to.
//!
//! The registers in this window are not one width. DTCCR is 8-bit at +0x00,
//! DTCVBR is 32-bit at +0x04, and DTCST (8-bit, +0x0C) and DTCSTS (16-bit,
//! +0x0E) SHARE THE WORD AT +0x0C. So an access here can name part of one
//! register (the high half of the vector base), or two whole registers at
//! once (the start bit and the status word in one word access), and the
//! answer has to be assembled a byte at a time.
//!
//! This file is only the map: which register owns a byte offset, which byte
//! of it that offset is, and whether the firmware may store there. The byte
//! arithmetic is `src/periph/bytelanes.zig`, and what each register MEANS
//! stays in `src/periph/dtc.zig`.
