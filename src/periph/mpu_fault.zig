//! What an access the MPU refuses does to the core: the MemManage status it
//! latches, and the violation waiting to become one.
//!
//! Armv8-M refuses a store into a region whose RBAR.AP says read-only, at
//! both privilege levels, and takes a MemManage for it. Unicorn's core models
//! no MPU at all, so nothing refuses the store and nothing takes the fault:
//! the enforcement is synthesised, with a write hook over each protected span
//! catching the store and the run loop turning it into an exception at the
//! chunk boundary. src/core/mpu_guard.zig is that half; this file is what it
//! records, kept apart so the bookkeeping can be tested without an engine.
//!
//!   CFSR 0xE000_ED28, MMFSR is its low byte (DDI0553 D1.2.11)
//!     IACCVIOL  [0] an instruction fetch the MPU refused
//!     DACCVIOL  [1] a data access the MPU refused, which is this one
//!     MMARVALID [7] MMFAR holds the address that took it
//!   MMFAR 0xE000_ED34: the address, valid only while MMARVALID stands.
