//! Write-one-to-clear on CFSR and HFSR.
//!
//! Every bit in CFSR (0xE000_ED28) and HFSR (0xE000_ED2C) is cleared by
//! writing a one to it, and a zero leaves it alone (DDI0553 D1.2.11,
//! D1.2.12). A fault handler acknowledges a fault with `CFSR = CFSR`: it
//! writes back exactly the bits it read, and they go down. The PPB here is
//! plain RAM, so that store leaves the word exactly as it was, and the
//! handler that checks the status went down reads the same fault forever.
//!
//! The write hook sees each store before it lands, so it cannot rewrite the
//! word itself: the store would overwrite whatever it put there. It latches
//! the store here instead, and the latch is applied at the next chunk
//! boundary, where the PPB is polled anyway. Until then a read of the word
//! returns what the firmware wrote. That window is at most one stretch.
//!
//! A stretch can hold several stores, and nothing on this board sets a
//! fault bit inside one: the MPU's synthesised faults are latched at the
//! boundary. So the word owed is the one from before the first store, less
//! every bit any of the stores wrote. A bit that came up after the last
//! store (one the boundary set before this latch was applied) is kept.
//!
//! Byte and halfword stores are honoured lane by lane, because CMSIS
//! reaches MMFSR, BFSR and UFSR as byte, byte and halfword registers.
