//! The WDT's three control registers take one write each after reset.
//!
//! HUM Ch 27.3.2 is called "Controlling Writes to the WDTCR, WDTRCR, and
//! WDTCSTPR Registers", and what it controls is how many: one apiece, after
//! which the register is deaf for the rest of the run. ra8_wdt.h states the
//! same rule against `ra8_wdt_init` in so many words, "The WDT control
//! registers can only be written once after reset (HUM Ch 27.3.2 ...), so
//! subsequent calls have no effect", and ra8_wdt.c repeats it in its own file
//! header: the driver "writes WDTCR / WDTRCR / WDTCSTPR exactly once and then
//! refreshes WDTRR to arm the counter".
//!
//! The refresh register is not one of the three and is not tracked here: a
//! watchdog would be useless if it were.
//!
//! This is a latch, not a lock with a key: nothing in the block reopens it.
//! Only a reset does, and a reset builds a new unit.
