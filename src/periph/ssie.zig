//! SSIE: the I2S serial sound interface, and the transmit FIFO that decides
//! when a sample written to it is actually on the wire.
//!
//! SSIE0 sits at 0x4025_D000 and SSIE1 0x100 above it (ra8_ssie_regs.h). A
//! driver brings a channel up by checking SSISR.IIRQ, programming SSICR and
//! SSIFCR, setting TEN, and then storing one sample per SSIFTDR write. There
//! is no audio clock and no I2S frame here: what a headless run can observe
//! is that handshake and the sample stream it produces, which is what the
//! `ssie_audio_loop` example is worth checking.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_ssie.c on dev, with three things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! THE TRANSMIT FIFO IS REAL, NOT A HOLE IN THE FLOOR. dev pins SSIFSR.TDE
//! set and drops every SSIFTDR store straight into a tally, so the register
//! never fills, never stalls, and never loses anything. Here it is a FIFO of
//! the part's own depth: TDE reads clear while it holds a sample, TDC reports
//! how many, and a store past the last stage is dropped and counted rather
//! than silently becoming a transmitted sample.
//!
//! A SAMPLE IS TRANSMITTED WHEN THE TRANSMITTER IS ON. dev counts every
//! SSIFTDR store whatever SSICR says, so an image whose TEN never took
//! reports a stream it never shifted out. Here a store with TEN clear stages
//! the sample, exactly as silicon fills the FIFO ahead of the enable, and
//! setting TEN drains what is staged; a run that never sets it reports the
//! samples as staged, which is the failure the tally was meant to catch.
//!
//! SSISR IS STATUS, NOT A SHADOW. dev stores a write to SSISR into the same
//! flat register array that its read path then ignores, so firmware can
//! neither set a flag nor clear one and cannot tell which happened. Here the
//! register is computed on read and a write to it changes nothing.
//!
//! THE FIFO ITSELF lives in src/periph/ssie_fifo.zig: the part's 32 stages,
//! SSIFSR's TDC count, and the SSIFCR resets that empty it. That file carries
//! the register fields and what is deliberately left alone in them.
//!
//! SSIFTDR IS A DATA PORT, NOT A BAG OF ADDRESSABLE LANES. A sample is one
//! 32-bit register write, and the stage behind it moves whole. dev, and this
//! model until now, clocked a sample on ANY store landing anywhere in the
//! register and built it out of the lanes that store named, so a driver
//! pushing one sample in two halfword stores staged TWO samples, each
//! carrying half the word with the other half zero, and a byte store to the
//! three bytes above the register staged a sample made of a byte. Here an
//! access narrower than the register carries no sample: it is refused and
//! counted, and the FIFO keeps what it already had. SSICR, SSIFCR and the
//! shadow are untouched by this: their lanes really are the bits a narrow
//! store names, which is what step 5 of fw/real/ssie.c does to SSICR.
//!
//! SSIFCR.SSIRST IS A COMMAND, NOT A STORED BIT. Bit 16 of SSIFCR is the
//! module's own software reset, the one HUM Table 46.9 is named after, and
//! both dev and this model until now merged it into the shadow and did
//! nothing else with it. The driver leans on it twice: at bring-up, and on
//! every error recovery, where ra8_ssie_start_recovery pulses it and then
//! does nothing but clear the SSISR error flags by hand. So a channel that
//! underran kept its transmitter on and kept the samples staged behind it,
//! and the run shifted out a stream the part would have thrown away. Worse,
//! SSICR.TEN stayed set, so SSISR.IIRQ read low forever and ra8_ssie_start
//! answered k_ra8_err_busy at the idle check on every later attempt to
//! restart the channel. Here the rising edge empties the transmit FIFO and
//! takes REN and TEN down, leaving the mode bits above them alone, which is
//! what ra8_ssie.h states as the post-condition of that call. The rule and
//! its evidence live in src/periph/ssie_reset.zig.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: SSIFSR's receive flags, and the write-0-to
//! -clear the header describes for RDF and TDE. TDE is computed from what the
//! FIFO is holding rather than latched, so a store to SSIFSR still changes
//! nothing; latching it would need the clear rule stated somewhere in one of
//! these trees, and it is not. The rest of the window is shadowed so a
//! read-modify-write survives, and never read. There is no receive source, so
//! SSIFRDR reads zero and RDC reads zero, as they do on dev.
