//! The DRW spatial limiters: which pixels of the bounding box the engine is
//! allowed to touch.
//!
//! drw.zig scans a bounding box; this decides, per pixel, whether the box is
//! actually painted there. Six edge limiters (HUM Ch 62.2.10-62.2.12,
//! LnSTART/LnXADD/LnYADD pp 3698-3699) each carry a linear form
//!
//!     value(x, y) = START + x * XADD + y * YADD
//!
//! in the 4-bit sub-pixel fixed point the HAL writes (ra8_drw_regs.h,
//! `k_ra8_drw_subpixel_unit` = 16). A limiter admits the half-plane where its
//! value is not negative, and CONTROL's union bits combine the six into one
//! answer down a fixed tree (HUM Ch 62.2.1 p 3689): L1/L2 -> A, L3/L4 -> B,
//! L5/L6 -> D, A/B -> C, C/D -> the final coverage. Every pair intersects
//! unless its UNION bit is set.
//!
//! That is the whole of what a line or a triangle is on this engine: four
//! perpendicular limiters for a stroke (ra8_drw_draw.c
//! `internal_program_line_limiters`, HUM Ch 62.4.4 p 3725), three edges for a
//! triangle. dev declined every one of them, so a firmware that drew anything
//! but an axis-aligned rectangle came back to a blank framebuffer.
//!
//! Two parts of the block are deliberately left out rather than guessed at,
//! because inventing pixels is the divergence this tree exists to prevent:
//!
//!   * QUAD1/2/3, the quadratic coupling that turns a limiter pair into a
//!     curve. It is a different evaluation, not a harder one, and no in-tree
//!     primitive programs it. drw.zig declines a render that enables one.
//!   * The anti-aliased edge. With LIMnTHRESHOLD clear the engine spreads
//!     coverage across the sub-pixel band at the boundary; the bench sweeps
//!     recorded in board_periph_drw.c on dev saw that coverage arrive as
//!     alpha 0x01-0x02 rather than a clean ramp, which no linear reading of
//!     HUM Ch 62.6.2.1 predicts. So the test here is the hard one either way,
//!     and every pixel that lands inside the boundary band is counted, so a
//!     run says how much of its picture sits where the two would differ.
