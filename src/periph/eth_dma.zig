//! The CPU agent's descriptor engine: the rings in guest RAM, the frames that
//! leave through them, and the frames that arrive into them.
//!
//! The firmware points the gateway at a LINKFIX table, hangs a chain of
//! descriptors off each entry, and kicks a queue through GWTRC. This walks
//! that, moves the bytes, and writes the descriptor back so the driver's
//! completion poll resolves.
//!
//! Ported from the TX/RX halves of board_periph_eth.c on dev, with five
//! things that model does not do.
//!
//! A FRAME ONLY MOVES ON A RUNNING GATEWAY. dev checks the mode before its
//! per-tick RX pump and not before a TX kick, so an image that kicks a queue
//! on a gateway still in CONFIG has its frame delivered in the emulator and
//! nothing on the bench. Refused and counted here.
//!
//! A BUFFER HAS TO BE IN RAM. dev follows the descriptor's pointer wherever
//! it points, reads the frame out of it and writes a received frame into it,
//! so a half-built ring has the emulator marshalling the peripheral window
//! into a frame and writing frame bytes over whatever the pointer happened to
//! hold. Descriptor and buffer must lie in the mapped SRAM window here.
//!
//! A RING THAT LINKS BACK ON ITSELF IS NOT WALKED SIXTY-FOUR TIMES. dev
//! refuses only a link straight back to the same descriptor, so a cycle two
//! links long is walked to the bound on every single tick. Any address seen
//! twice ends the walk here, counted.
//!
//! A FRAME TOO BIG FOR THE SLOT IS NOT CUT INTO IT. dev asks the far end for
//! as many bytes as the slot holds and stages whatever comes back, so a frame
//! longer than the slot is delivered truncated and counted as received. Here
//! it stays queued and is counted, which is what a MAC with no room does.
//!
//! A DESCRIPTOR IS COMPLETED WHEN THE FRAME LEFT. dev's sink swallows
//! everything, so the descriptor comes back FEMPTY whatever happened. Here a
//! far end with no room leaves the descriptor owned by the gateway, and the
//! driver's own retry sees it.
