//! ELC: the event link controller, which lets one event trigger a peripheral
//! without the CPU in the middle.
//!
//! A peripheral on this part raises a numbered event. The ICU decides which
//! NVIC line that event drives (src/periph/icu.zig); the ELC decides which
//! *peripheral* it drives, so an ADC conversion can start a DMA transfer or a
//! timer can start an ADC with no interrupt taken at all. It also owns the
//! only way firmware has to raise an event itself: the four software event
//! generators, ELSEGR0..3, which produce ELC_SWEVT0..3.
//!
//!   ELCR     (+0x000, 8b)  ELCON b7: the global enable for the whole block
//!   ELSEGRn  (+0x004, 8b, stride 4) WI b7, WE b6, SEG b0: software events
//!   ELSR[n]  (+0x020, 16b, stride 4) ELS [9:0]: the event peripheral n takes
//!   ELCSARx  (+0x100/4/8, 32b) security attribution, stored, not enforced
//!   ELCPARx  (+0x110/4/8, 32b) privilege attribution, stored, not enforced
//!
//! NOTHING WAS PORTED FROM dev, BECAUSE dev NEVER MODELLED THIS BLOCK. The C
//! tree carries inc/ra8_elc_regs.h and ten blocks that talk about ELC events
//! (adc, canfd, dmac, dtc, ipc, npu, rtc, sci, timer, ulpt), and no
//! board_periph_elc.c. So every ELC register there falls through to the
//! sparse register file, which remembers what was written: a firmware runs
//! the three-step ELSEGR0 sequence, reads 0x41 back, and believes it fired a
//! software event, while no event exists and nothing downstream ever runs.
//! The register layout here is ra8_elc_regs.h and HUM Ch 19 p 817..836.
//!
//! The map itself, and which lanes of a word each register occupies, is
//! src/periph/elc_regs.zig; this file is the behaviour behind it.
