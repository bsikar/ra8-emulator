//! IPC: the cross-core mailbox, and which core a poke is meant to wake.
//!
//! The IPC unit sits at 0x4002_0000 and carries four channel windows from
//! 0xC0 up, 0x20 apart: IPC0 channels 0 and 1 run CPU1 -> CPU0, IPC1
//! channels 2 and 3 run CPU0 -> CPU1. A channel is a pending-IRQ byte plus a
//! four-stage message FIFO. The sender pushes a word into TXD and pokes
//! ISET; the receiver takes the interrupt, reads STA to see which line was
//! set, drains RXD while STA.RDY is up, and acknowledges through CLR. That
//! handshake is what the dual-core examples replace their done-flag polls
//! with, so it is what a headless run can check.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_ipc.c on dev, with three things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! A POKE WAKES THE RECEIVER, NOT THE SENDER. dev raises the event on
//! whichever engine performed the ISET store, for every channel, so a CPU0
//! write to an IPC1 channel raises ELC_EVENT_IPC_IRQ1 on CPU0 itself: the
//! core that sent the message takes the interrupt announcing it. Here the
//! receiving side decides. IPC0 channels raise into this board's event path,
//! because their receiver is the core this build runs; an IPC1 poke is
//! counted as addressed to a core that is not here and raises nothing, which
//! is what the run should say rather than a wake that went the wrong way.
//!
//! THE SEMAPHORES TAKE THE LOCK. dev answers zero to every read below the
//! first channel window and drops every write there, so a driver that
//! claims a semaphore and reads it back to see whether it won reads zero
//! forever and can spin without end. Here IPCSEMn and the two NMI
//! doorbells are a model of their own in ipc_sync.zig: a read of a
//! semaphore takes the lock as a side effect and hands back the value from
//! before it, the way HUM Ch 3.2.3 p 210 specifies, so the second claimant
//! is told it lost. What is left of the region below 0xC0 is still shadow.
//!
//! A DROPPED MESSAGE IS COUNTED. dev latches FERR on a write into a full
//! FIFO and RERR on a read of an empty one, and its end-of-run line prints
//! only pushes and pops, so a run that overran the four stages reads exactly
//! like one that did not. The latches are kept, and the words the FIFO could
//! not take and the reads that found nothing are counted and reported.
//!
//! THE MESSAGE PORTS ARE WORD PORTS. TXD and RXD carry one 32-bit message,
//! not a bag of independently addressable bits the way STA, ISET and CLR do,
//! and the FIFO stage behind them moves whole. So a store narrower than a
//! word would push a message three quarters of which the firmware never
//! wrote, and a load narrower than a word would consume a stage and hand
//! back one lane of it with the rest gone for good. Both are refused and
//! counted here rather than taken: the FIFO keeps what it has, and the run
//! says the access was the wrong width. dev takes either one, so on that
//! tree a driver reading a message through two halfword loads drains two
//! stages and assembles a word out of the low halves of both.
//!
//! THE SEMAPHORES BELOW THE CHANNELS take the same question and answer it
//! differently, because LOCK is one bit rather than a message: an access
//! that names bit 0 carries the lock whatever its width, and one that does
//! not carries nothing and must not take it. ipc_sync.zig owns that rule;
//! this file's job is to hand it the lanes the access actually named
//! instead of only the offset it landed on.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: any IPC interrupt besides the two receive
//! events, and NMI delivery, which is latched and counted here but reaches
//! no core. The event is queued for the chunk boundary rather than raised
//! inside the store, which is how every other block on this board offers
//! one.
