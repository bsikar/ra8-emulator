//! IPCSAR / IPCPAR: which IPC channels the Secure world handed over, and the
//! protection gate that has to be open before either word will land.
//!
//! The four IPC channels are Secure and Privileged out of cold reset, so a
//! Non-Secure application cannot reach the mailbox at all until the Secure
//! boot gives it away. Two words in the CPSCU window do the giving: IPCSAR
//! at 0x4000_8610 marks a channel Non-Secure, IPCPAR at 0x4000_8614 marks it
//! Unprivileged (HUM Ch 3.2.1 "IPCSAR" p 205, Ch 3.2.2 "IPCPAR" p 207). The
//! bit is active-high for the permissive state, which ra8_ipc_types.h states
//! twice in so many words, so a set bit is a channel given away and a clear
//! one is a channel kept.
//!
//! BOTH WORDS ARE GATED BY PRCR_S.PRC4 and that gate is the whole reason
//! this block exists rather than letting the sparse register file keep
//! answering. A store issued with PRC4 shut is discarded by silicon with no
//! fault and no status bit, exactly like every other protected register, and
//! the firmware in this tree depends on it: cpu1_pingpong_ipc's
//! trustzone_init.c carries a paragraph saying that
//! ra8_tz_secure_boot_security_init "opens PRC4 for the IPCSAR write then
//! relocks the whole PRCR_S, so the writes inside ra8_cpu1_release are
//! silently dropped without an explicit unlock here", with the bench symptom
//! recorded next to it. The library's own security_init brackets the pair
//! between a gateOpen and a gateClose for the same reason. The sparse file
//! took the store whenever it arrived, so a firmware that forgot the unlock
//! was told it had given the channels away and every later read agreed.
//!
//! THE ATTRIBUTION IS RECORDED, NOT ENFORCED, which is the same line the SAU
//! model holds: nothing here refuses an IPC access because the channel was
//! kept Secure. A single-image headless run has no second world to refuse on
//! behalf of, and inventing a refusal would stop the apps that reach the
//! mailbox from the Secure side. What the run can honestly say is which
//! channels the boot gave away and whether the words it wrote landed, and
//! that is what the report carries.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the rest of the CPSCU attribution window.
//! BUSSARA/B/C, MMPUSARA/B and CPUSAR are written by the same boot and are
//! still shadow, because they attribute the bus arbiter and the master MPU,
//! neither of which this board models; giving them a home here would be a
//! register file pretending to be a decision.
