//! IWDT: the watchdog OFS0 starts, that software cannot stop, and that only
//! the two-byte sequence keeps alive.
//!
//! The Independent Watchdog Timer at 0x4020_2200 (HUM Ch 28, FSP
//! R_IWDT_BASE) is a 14-bit down-counter on its own ~15 kHz oscillator,
//! outside the CPU clock tree, so it survives a MOCO or HOCO failure that
//! stops WDT0. Its period, window and reset-versus-NMI choice live in the
//! OFS0 option-setting register rather than in these registers: on the RA8D2
//! there is no register-start mode, and IWDTCR / IWDTRCR / IWDTCSTPR are
//! write-locked once the boot ROM has armed the timer. The runtime surface
//! is what `ra8_iwdt.c` uses: refresh, read the counter, read and clear the
//! status.
//!
//! Nothing answered here before this file; the window fell through to the
//! sparse register file, which keeps whatever it is handed. That made two
//! real firmware paths pass in the model and fail on the bench.
//!
//! One: a single write to IWDTRR looked like a refresh. It is not one; the
//! sequence rule lives in iwdt_refresh.zig.
//!
//! Two: IWDTSR.CNTVAL never moved, so `iwdt_demo`, which refreshes only when
//! the counter has fallen inside its window, waits for a value that a cell
//! will never produce and burns its whole budget. The counter counts here,
//! and iwdt_status.zig keeps it read-only against the driver's own status
//! clear, which writes the counter bits back.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT modelled. The IWDTCR TOPS and CKS encodings are
//! not written down in either tree (the header gives their bit positions and
//! says OFS0 is the effective control surface), so no period table is
//! invented: the counter runs the full 14-bit range and the fields ride in
//! the register. `counts_per_tick` below is an emulator-time choice in the
//! same spirit as wdt.zig's, not a silicon number. IWDTCSTPR.SLCSTP halts
//! the counter in Sleep, and Sleep is not modelled, so it rides too.
