//! The extra-MRAM controller: program/erase mode, the command the sequencer
//! collected, and whether the option-setting memory is allowed to take it.
//!
//! Three windows share one model, the way one block of silicon does. The
//! MRMS program-mode registers sit at 0x4013_E000 (MSADDR, MSTATR, MENTRYR,
//! MASTAT), the MACI command-issuing port at 0x4012_0000, and the code-MRAM
//! program-control page at 0x4013_F000. The driver's sequence is MENTRYR =
//! 0xAA80 to enter program/erase mode, MSADDR = the target, the command
//! stream through the port, a poll of MSTATR for MRDY and the error mask,
//! then MENTRYR = 0xAA00 on the way out.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_mram.c on dev, with five things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! MSTATR IS WHAT THE SEQUENCER LEFT. dev answers every MSTATR read with
//! MRDY and nothing else, including straight after its own reject path has
//! latched ILGCOMERR and ILGLERR into the shadow. So a driver that issues an
//! illegal Program, polls MRDY and checks the error mask, which is exactly
//! the sequence dev's own header documents, reads a clean completion. Here
//! MSTATR reports the latched errors beside MRDY.
//!
//! COMMAND-LOCKED ACTUALLY LOCKS. HUM Ch 59.7.4.4 p 3590: once the
//! sequencer is command-locked, MACI commands cannot be accepted. dev
//! latches CMDLK and then runs the next command anyway. Here a command
//! arriving locked is refused and counted, and the lock is released by
//! leaving program/erase mode. That release is this model's own rule, not a
//! ported one: no opcode for Status Clear or Forced Stop is in this tree to
//! take, and a lock with no way out would hang an image rather than tell it
//! anything.
//!
//! A COMMAND NEEDS PROGRAM/ERASE MODE, AND MENTRYR NEEDS ITS KEY. dev runs
//! the command stream whether or not MENTRYR was ever written, and takes any
//! value with bit 7 set as an entry, key or no key. Both are refused and
//! counted here; the key is the 0xAA the two writes dev's own header
//! documents both carry.
//!
//! A PAUSE IS A STATE, NOT A WRITE THAT VANISHES. MENTRYR.PCKA is the gate
//! ra8_flash_suspend and ra8_flash_resume drive: suspend stores the keyed
//! pause pattern 0xAAC0 and polls for PCKA standing, resume stores 0xAA80
//! and polls for it gone. Neither dev nor this model carried the bit at
//! all, and MENTRYR reads back the mode bit alone, so every suspend spun
//! its whole 0x10000-iteration budget and returned a hw timeout, while
//! every resume answered instantly whether or not anything was paused.
//! PCKA now follows the keyed write and reads back beside MENTRY, and
//! leaving program/erase mode drops it the way it drops the lock.
//!
//! STATUS IS CONTROLLER-OWNED. dev stores any value written anywhere in the
//! window into its shadow, MSTATR and MASTAT included, so firmware can clear
//! the error bits its own illegal command raised. Refused and counted here,
//! the way this tree already treats CETCR, SRAMESR and INTS. Narrow writes
//! keep the bytes they do not name, where dev's regs[off / 4] = value wipes
//! them.
//!
//! THE KEY HAS TO BE IN THE WRITE. MENTRYR is a sixteen-bit register whose
//! high half is the key and whose bit 7 is the mode, and the driver writes
//! the pair in one halfword store, 0xAA80 in and 0xAA00 out. The key was
//! judged on the word AFTER the store had been folded into the shadow, so
//! the 0xAA of an earlier keyed write stayed there and vouched for every
//! later access: a byte store of 0x80 at MENTRYR, which names no part of
//! the key at all, read as 0xAA80 and entered program/erase mode. Now an
//! access has to name the whole register, and the key is read out of the
//! value the access itself carries, never out of what was already stored.
//! A store that names less than the register carries no key, so it is
//! refused and counted and the mode does not move. This is the SSIFTDR and
//! TXD cut applied to a protection key rather than to a data port. MENTRYR
//! is sixteen bits, so an access landing entirely in the two bytes above it
//! names no part of the register and still merges into the shadow the way
//! it always did.
//!
//! MSUINITR IS A KICK, AND THE SEQUENCER TAKES SUINIT BACK DOWN. It fell
//! into the generic shadow below, so a store landed 0xAA01 in a word and a
//! read handed it straight back: SUINIT was still standing on every poll
//! and ra8_flash_msuinitr_kick always ran out its spin limit and returned
//! a hardware timeout. The rule and its evidence are in mram_init.zig.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the 0x4013_C000 wait-state and ECC
//! configuration pages, which stay sparse because ra8_cgc_init programs them
//! during clock setup with a key-strip readback this model would have to
//! invent; the erase and blank-check commands; and every MSTATR bit besides
//! MRDY and the two illegal-command latches. The code-MRAM page is its own
//! file, mram_code.zig: MRCPS still reads idle-and-ready the way dev leaves
//! it, and a store to it is refused there for the same reason a store to
//! MSTATR is refused here.
