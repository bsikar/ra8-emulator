//! AIRCR: the software reset a firmware asks for, and the key that gates it.
//!
//! `ra8_reset_software_reset` (and CMSIS `NVIC_SystemReset` under it) ends the
//! same way every time: store `0x05FA` in the top half of AIRCR together with
//! SYSRESETREQ, then spin in a `for (;;)` waiting for the part to go away. The
//! PPB is plain RAM here, so that store landed in a word nothing read and the
//! firmware span out the rest of its budget in the wait loop.
//!
//! This block is the watcher dev keeps in emu_exc_scs.c, moved to the seam the
//! rest of this tree uses for the PPB: the clocks and the interrupt controller
//! already read and write SCB words at the chunk boundary, so AIRCR is polled
//! there too rather than hooked per access. The cost is that a write is noticed
//! at the end of the chunk it happened in, and two writes inside one chunk are
//! seen as one. The reset request is the only thing here that has to be prompt,
//! and a chunk early or late makes no difference to it.
//!
//!   AIRCR 0xE000_ED0C (DDI0553 D1.2.6)
//!     VECTKEY     [31:16] write:  must be 0x05FA or the whole write is dropped
//!     VECTKEYSTAT [31:16] read:   always 0xFA05, never what was written
//!     PRIGROUP    [10:8]  retained, read/write
//!     SYSRESETREQ [2]     write-only, asks the system for a reset
//!     VECTCLRACTIVE [1]   write-only, and not modelled beyond being dropped
