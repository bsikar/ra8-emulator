//! WDT0: the window watchdog, so a missed refresh actually times out.
//!
//! The Window Watchdog Timer at 0x4020_2600 (HUM Ch 27) is a down-counter the
//! firmware has to keep reloading. Two things end a run on silicon: letting it
//! reach zero, and refreshing it *too early*. The second is the one that gets
//! missed. The counter has a permitted refresh window, and a reload issued
//! before the window opens is a refresh error, which with WDTRCR.RSTIRQS set
//! resets the part exactly as an underflow does. A watchdog service routine
//! called from a fast loop trips it, and the failure looks like a spontaneous
//! reboot rather than a watchdog fault.
//!
//!   WDTRR  (+0x00, 8b)   refresh register: 0x00 then 0xFF reloads the counter
//!   WDTCR  (+0x02, 16b)  TOPS timeout, CKS divider, RPSS/RPES window edges
//!   WDTSR  (+0x04, 16b)  CNTVAL[13:0] live counter, UNDFF[14], REFEF[15]
//!   WDTRCR (+0x06, 8b)   RSTIRQS: 1 = reset on underflow, 0 = NMI/IRQ
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_wdt.c on dev, with three departures from it, all
//! of them places where firmware that fails on the bench passes there.
//!
//! One: dev models no refresh window at all, so a refresh is always accepted
//! ("the model does not synthesise the refresh-error path"). Here the counter
//! position is checked against RPSS/RPES and an early reload latches REFEF and
//! refuses to reload, which is what the hardware does.
//!
//! Two: dev clears UNDFF on the next refresh, so a driver that never reads the
//! flag still sees a clean status register. HUM Ch 27.2.3 p 1076 gives both
//! flags one way down, a write of ZERO to the bit, so they are sticky here and
//! only a write-zero takes them off. Write-one clears nothing, the same
//! opposite polarity that bit the ICU (IR) and the voltage monitors (DET).
//!
//! Three: dev maps every timeout to one constant number of chunks, so a
//! firmware that shortens its timeout period sees no change and a firmware
//! that lengthens it sees no change either. Here the counter holds watchdog
//! counts, TOPS cycles less one after a reload the way CNTVAL reads on
//! silicon, so a driver comparing CNTVAL against its own window bounds
//! (wdt_window_demo checks 256..768 of 1024) reads the units it expects.
//! How many ticks one count takes comes from src/periph/wdt/wdt_clock.zig,
//! which carries the bench's measured rate.
//!
//! Four: the three control registers take one write each after reset and are
//! deaf afterwards (HUM Ch 27.3.2, and see src/periph/wdt_write_once.zig).
//! dev took every write, so a firmware reconfiguring its watchdog mid-run got
//! the new settings here and keeps the old ones on the bench. WDTCSTPR is the
//! register that makes it bite: ra8_wdt_init programmes it, and then
//! ra8_wdt_deinit, ra8_wdt_enter_stop and ra8_wdt_exit_stop each write it
//! again expecting the Sleep-stop posture to follow them. On silicon none of
//! those three land. The register did not exist in this model at all before,
//! so it reads its programmed value now rather than zero.
//!
//! Deliberately untouched: WDTRCR keeps returning every bit it was given even
//! though only RSTIRQS is implemented, and the odd byte above each 8-bit
//! control register still reaches it the way it always has here. Both are the
//! narrow-access vein, not this rule.
