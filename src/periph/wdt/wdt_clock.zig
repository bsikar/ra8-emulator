//! How fast WDT0 counts, in run-loop ticks per watchdog count.
//!
//! The firmware measured it, so this model takes the bench's number rather
//! than the manual's. examples/ek_ra8d2/hw_validated/hil/wdt_window_demo/
//! src/main.c records it next to its window bounds: "the WWDT counts on a
//! ~40 Hz base clock (chip's WDT clock source -- not PCLKB despite the HUM
//! nomenclature), so the 1024-cycle period runs ~25 s", with CKS at /4.
//! wdt_supervisor_demo programmes the same TOPS and CKS and refreshes every
//! 50 ms, so on the bench it never comes near underflow.
//!
//! The model before this counted one watchdog cycle per 3906 instructions,
//! dev's 128 cycles per 500000-instruction chunk, which made that 25 s
//! period about 4 ms and had the supervisor underflow after every refresh.
//!
//! The divider still scales the rate: ra8_wdt.h names CKS a divider of the
//! counter's clock, and the bench figure is the /4 point of it. That other
//! dividers scale from /4 the way their names say is the manual's claim, not
//! a bench reading, and is the one inference here.
