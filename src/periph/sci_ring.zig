//! A serial channel's receive ring: the bytes a host or a device on the line
//! has driven back and the firmware has not read out of RDR yet.
//!
//! Split out of src/periph/sci.zig, which owns the channel, the status words
//! and the transmit gate, the same way src/periph/sci_line.zig owns the
//! console line buffer.
//!
//! FIXED CAPACITY ON PURPOSE. There is no allocator below the bus in this
//! model, and a real UART drops what it cannot hold too. What makes the drop
//! worth reporting rather than swallowing is that it is an OVERRUN: a
//! character arrived with the previous one still unread, which is exactly
//! what CSR.ORER reports. So `push` says whether it lost anything and the
//! channel latches that into the flag; see src/periph/sci_status.zig for the
//! bit and for what clears it.
