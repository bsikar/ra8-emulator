//! DOTF REG00: the AES control word, and the self-test bit that has to clear.
//!
//! REG00 is the one register the DOTF driver drives hard. Bit 9 enables the
//! AES core, bits 25:24 pick the key size and bits 29:28 the cipher mode,
//! which on this part is CTR and nothing else (HUM Ch 45.1 p 3048). Bit 20
//! is the self-test trigger, and it is the bit that matters to a model:
//! `ra8_dotf_self_test` writes it and then waits for the SAME bit to read
//! back clear, so a register that simply stores what it is given never
//! finishes the test. The driver spins out its budget and reports a hardware
//! timeout on a part that is working.
//!
//! Bit names are the FSP field names the header kept verbatim
//! (ra8_dotf_regs.h ra8_dotf_reg00_bit_t / ra8_dotf_reg00_mask_t, cited
//! there against R_DOTF_REG00_b). HUM Ch 45 documents REG00 only as the AES
//! control word and gives no symbolic names, so the positions come from the
//! header and this file says so rather than implying a HUM bit table.
//!
//! WHAT IS NOT MODELLED, AND MUST NOT BE INVENTED: the decryption itself.
//! There is no AES core here and no key: the key and IV words go in through
//! REG03 and are counted, never used, and a read through the XSPI window
//! returns the stored bytes exactly as it did before. Nothing in either tree
//! says what a failed self-test reports either, so the test always passes,
//! which is what the bit clearing means.
