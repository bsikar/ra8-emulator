//! MPU_TYPE: how many data regions the core says it has, and why a zero there
//! parks an image in `main`.
//!
//! The PPB is plain RAM in this model, so every MPU register a firmware writes
//! lands and reads back for free. TYPE is the one that does not work that way:
//! it is read-only and hardwired, and nothing writes it, so it read as zero.
//! `ra8_mpu_configure` opens by validating capacity, `if (cfg.region_count >
//! dregionCount()) return .invalid_arg`, and every RA8 image that programs the
//! MPU asks for at least one region. So the call was rejected before it touched
//! a single register, and `main` spun forever on the `wfi` beside its call site:
//!
//!     bl      ra8_mpu_configure
//!     cmp     r3, #0
//!     beq.n   main+0x22        ; the rest of main, never taken
//!     wfi                      ; ... and the branch back to it
//!
//! threadx_mpu_partition_demo never reached `_tx_initialize_kernel_enter` for
//! this reason: no SysTick armed, no interrupt taken, nothing to show for a
//! whole budget. dev's C emulator seeds the same word for the same reason, and
//! says so at `k_mpu_type_seed` in emu_exc.h: 8 data regions, matching the
//! Cortex-M85 the RA8D2 carries. That count is taken from there, not guessed.
//!
//!   MPU_TYPE 0xE000_ED90 (DDI0553 D1.2.16)
//!     DREGION [15:8] read-only, hardwired: the number of data regions
//!     SEPARATE [0]   read-only, zero: one unified region set
//!
//! TWO THINGS THIS BLOCK DOES NOT DO, both measured with
//! fw/probe/mpuregions.c rather than assumed, and both left for later slices.
//!
//! RBAR/RLAR ARE BANKED THROUGH RNR, and that is the second thing this block
//! had to learn. On silicon RNR selects which of the eight region pairs the
//! one RBAR/RLAR address reaches. The PPB is plain RAM here and RBAR is one
//! word, so every region programmed landed on top of the last one, and the
//! table was read back at a poll rather than as it was written. That is not a
//! cosmetic gap: `ra8_mpu_configure` programs the table and then CLEARS THE
//! UNUSED TAIL, one `RNR = i; RLAR = 0` per unimplemented region, so the last
//! write any configuration leaves behind is a zeroed RLAR. Read back over RAM
//! that says the firmware enabled nothing, and threadx_mpu_partition_demo
//! reported "0 of 8 region(s) enabled" after programming four.
//!
//! So the writes are watched instead of the words: `observe` takes each store
//! into the window and files it under the region RNR names, and a store to RNR
//! puts that region's pair back into the RAM the firmware reads, which is what
//! makes a readback after an RNR change give the right region. The three alias
//! pairs reach the three regions after the selected one, which is how a driver
//! programs four regions without touching RNR again.
//!
//! THE TABLE IS WHAT ENFORCEMENT READS. A store into a read-only region is a
//! MemManage violation on silicon and Unicorn's core models no MPU, so the
//! exception is synthesised from a write hook over each protected span:
//! src/core/mpu_guard.zig keeps those traps, src/periph/mpu_fault.zig holds
//! what they catch, and this block is the table they are built from. So a
//! region captured wrongly here is now a fault taken wrongly rather than a
//! line in the report, which is why `observe` says what each store meant
//! rather than leaving the caller to work it out from the address.
