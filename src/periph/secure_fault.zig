//! Raising a SecureFault for a violation of the Security Extension.
//!
//! SecureFault is exception 7, with its own status register, SFSR, and its
//! own address register, SFAR. The causes are an invalid entry point from
//! Non-secure state (INVEP, a branch into Secure memory that is not an SG in
//! an NSC region), an invalid integrity signature or EXC_RETURN on an
//! exception return (INVIS, INVER), a Non-secure access to Secure memory
//! (AUVIOL), a branch to Non-secure code that did not say so (INVTRAN), and
//! the two lazy state errors (LSPERR, LSERR). An attribution violation and a
//! lazy state preservation error also latch SFAR with SFARVALID.
//!
//! It is taken like the other configurable faults: its own vector while
//! SHCSR.SECUREFAULTENA stands and it can preempt, HardFault with
//! HFSR.FORCED otherwise. Deciding that an access or a branch violates
//! attribution needs the core's security state (RA8EMU-41); this file only
//! raises what that check reports.
//!
