//! MIPI CSI-2 receiver: the camera side of the D-PHY, so its short-packet
//! clear can finish.
//!
//! One window at 0x4034_7000 (ra8_glcdc_regs.h, k_ra8_mipi_csi_base_addr,
//! above the D-PHY at 0x4034_6C00 this block sits on). Nothing modelled it,
//! so every access fell through to the sparse register file, and that had
//! teeth in one place: GSST is read-only status the firmware never writes,
//! so the sparse file answered zero forever.
//! ra8_mipi_csi_short_packet_clear_fifo drives GSIU.GFCLR and then spins on
//! GSST.GCD for k_ra8_mipi_csi_gfclr_spin_max = 1024 polls; against zero it
//! burned the whole budget and returned a hardware timeout on a part that
//! had cleared the FIFO instantly. Same shape as the D-PHY's PWRSF and
//! PLLSF last slice: a flag that never rises.
//!
//! Second, quieter: MCG is a read-only module-configuration word carrying
//! the core version, the supported lane count and the FIFO depth.
//! ra8_mipi_csi_capabilities decodes it, and zero told the caller the part
//! supports no lanes and has no short-packet FIFO.
//!
//!   MCG   (+0x000)  module configuration, read-only, derived here

//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: reception itself. No sensor drives this
//! block here, so the packet queue is only ever empty, PNUM reads zero and
//! ra8_mipi_csi_read_short_packet honestly returns "empty" rather than a
//! header this file made up. The lane and virtual-channel status words are
//! error latches fed by a real link, so they stay a shadow the firmware
//! reads back what it wrote into; nothing in either tree says what a lane
//! reports when there is no lane. The reset is instantaneous, because
//! neither tree carries a drain time, so RTST.VSRSTS reads clear and the
//! init spin ends on its first poll.
