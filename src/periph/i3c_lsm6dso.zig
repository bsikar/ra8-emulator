//! The ST LSM6DSO 6-DoF IMU on the carrier's I2C line, 7-bit address 0x6B
//! (the 6DOF IMU 12 Click ties SA0 high).
//!
//! The part is a register file behind an eight-bit pointer: a transfer names
//! its start register in the first write byte, then config bytes land or a
//! burst read serves from there, the pointer auto-incrementing either way. A
//! driver probes WHO_AM_I, sets an output data rate, then reads the gyro and
//! accelerometer blocks.
//!
//! What dev never checked is whether the part had been started. Its output
//! registers were seeded at reset and served from power-down, so an image
//! that never wrote CTRL1_XL or CTRL2_G read steady motion in the emulator
//! and nothing at all on the bench. It also carried a flat 256-byte file
//! that took a write anywhere, so a driver could store over WHO_AM_I and
//! have the part identify as whatever it had just written.
