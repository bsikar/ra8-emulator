//! CAN-FD: the two controllers, the mode state machine a driver waits on,
//! and the difference between a frame that was transmitted and one that was
//! received.
//!
//! CANFD0 sits at 0x4038_0000 and CANFD1 at 0x4038_2000, each a 0x1920-byte
//! channel window (ra8_canfd_regs.h, FSP R_CANFD_Type). There is no bus and
//! no other node here, so what a headless run can observe is the internal
//! loopback the `canfd_loopback` and `canfd_filter` examples drive: out of
//! reset mode, program the filter, write a frame into TX message buffer 0,
//! assert CFDTMC[0].TMTR, then poll RX FIFO 0 and read the frame back.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_canfd.c on dev, with five things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! THE PART COMES UP IN RESET MODE. dev powers every register up at zero, and
//! zero in CFDGSTS reads as operation mode, so an image that never programmed
//! the state machine transmits there and would sit in global reset on
//! silicon. Here both machines power up in reset, which is also what the
//! driver's first poll is waiting to see.
//!
//! A TRANSMIT NEEDS AN OPERATING CHANNEL. dev copies the TX buffer into the
//! receive stage on any TMTR whatever the two mode registers say. Here a
//! request made while either machine is out of operation mode moves nothing:
//! it is refused and counted, so the run says the channel was never started.
//!
//! THE RECEIVE SIDE IS A FIFO. dev keeps one stage and overwrites it, so a
//! second frame delivered before the firmware reads silently replaces the
//! first and the reader never learns it missed one. Here the stages queue,
//! oldest first, and a delivery with no stage free is counted as lost.
//!
//! A POP TAKES A FRAME THAT WAS THERE. dev's CFDRFPCTR write sets RFEMP and
//! drops RFIF whatever the FIFO holds, so a pop with nothing queued reports
//! an empty FIFO the firmware never drained, and the window keeps answering
//! with the frame it last held. Here a pop of an empty FIFO is refused and
//! counted, and the window reads zero once the last frame has been taken.
//!
//! STATUS IS WHAT THE CONTROLLER RAISED. dev drops every store into the flat
//! register array, so firmware can write CFDRFSTS itself and read back a
//! frame that never arrived. Refused and counted here, the SRAMESR / CETCR /
//! INTS pattern, and narrow writes keep the bytes they do not name, which
//! dev's reg[off / 4] = value wipes.
//!
//! AN ERROR FLAG IS THE CONTROLLER'S TO RAISE. CFDCnERFL was not interpreted
//! at all, so it fell into the flat shadow and read back whatever was last
//! written at it. The flags are write-ZERO-to-clear, so a driver that acks
//! them the way most CAN parts want, by writing ones, SET all fifteen here,
//! and the driver's own clear writes the inverse of its mask so the rest
//! survived their own acknowledgement. The dispatch then hands that word to
//! the application as errors that never happened. The rule and its evidence
//! live in src/periph/canfd_error.zig.
//!
//! KEPT FROM DEV DELIBERATELY: the acceptance filter and its open-when-empty
//! rule, so an image that programs no CFDGAFL entry keeps receiving
//! everything, and a programmed entry drops the identifier it does not match.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: bit timing and the rate registers, the
//! other RX FIFOs and the receive buffers, TX queues and history, error
//! counters and the bus-off machine, and every interrupt besides the
//! RX-FIFO one. The rest of the window is shadowed, and never read.
