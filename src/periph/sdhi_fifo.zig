//! What one SD_BUF0 access comes to: the data-phase rules, kept apart from
//! the register window in sdhi.zig the way dtc_xfer.zig and dmac_xfer.zig sit
//! beside their blocks. The window owns registers, flags and counters; this
//! owns whether a word moves at all and what the card does with a finished
//! block.
//!
//! THE CARD CAN REFUSE A BLOCK. `sdhi_card.Card` answers false for a block
//! off the end of it, and both sides of the FIFO used to throw that answer
//! away: a read staged zeros and raised BRE over them, and a write dropped
//! the block, walked the address on and cleared BWE at the end of the count.
//! Either way a driver was told a transfer it never got had finished. A
//! refused block now ENDS the phase: the blocks that landed stay landed, the
//! buffer flag comes down, and the run says how many blocks were lost.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED AND NOT GUESSED: the card status bit a real part sets for an
//! address off its end. The response registers here carry what the command
//! itself answered; nothing invents an error code the rest of the model does
//! not carry, so the only sign of a lost block is the flag that never comes
//! up and the report line at the end of the run.
