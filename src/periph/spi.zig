//! SPI_B: the Type-B SPI controller, and the difference between a frame that
//! was clocked out and one the firmware only wrote down.
//!
//! SPI0 sits at 0x4035_C000 and SPI1 0x100 above it (ra8_spi_regs.h). The
//! polling driver brings a channel up by programming SPCR2, setting SPCR.SPE,
//! then clocking one 8-bit frame per SPDR store: wait for SPSR.SPTEF, write
//! SPDR, wait for SPSR.SPRF, read SPDR, clear through SPSRC. There is no bit
//! clock and no pin here, so what a headless run can observe is that
//! handshake and the frames it moved, which is what the `spi_loopback`
//! example is worth checking.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_spi.c on dev, with four things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! A FRAME NEEDS AN ENABLED CHANNEL. dev echoes and counts every SPDR store
//! whatever SPCR says, so an image whose SPE never took still reports frames
//! it never clocked, and the receive holding register answers as if the wire
//! were live. Here a store to a disabled channel moves nothing: it is
//! refused and counted, so the run says the channel was never started.
//!
//! A RECEIVED FRAME IS TAKEN ONCE. dev leaves the echoed word in the holding
//! register and SPRF set until SPSRC clears it, so a second SPDR read hands
//! back a frame that was never received. Here a read consumes it: SPRF and
//! SPDRF drop, and a read with nothing pending is refused and counted, the
//! same starve the PDM FIFO reports.
//!
//! CENDF MEANS THE FRAME ENDED. dev names the flag in its own status enum
//! and never asserts it, so a driver that waits for communication end rather
//! than receive-full waits forever. Here a completed frame raises it and
//! SPSRC clears it.
//!
//! NARROW WRITES KEEP THE BYTES THEY DO NOT NAME. dev drops the whole value
//! into reg[off / 4], so a byte or halfword store to SPCR2 wipes the loopback
//! bits above it and the tie silently comes undone.
//!
//! THE FRAME IS AS WIDE AS SPCMD0 SAYS. dev masks the inverting loopback
//! path to a byte and echoes the whole word on the non-inverting one, which
//! cannot both be right, and neither reads the data length. Here SPCMD0.SPB
//! picks the width and SPCMD0.LSBF the bit order, so a 16- or 32-bit
//! transfer moves what the driver put in SPDR rather than its low byte; see
//! spi_frame.zig. A device on the line takes the frame a byte at a time,
//! most significant first, which is the order a wire clocks them in.
//!
//! A DEVICE CAN BE ON THE LINE. A channel with no loopback and nothing
//! attached clocks in an idle zero, as it does on dev with no card and no
//! display; a channel with a device attached hands it the frame and takes
//! back what it drives. Only one device per channel, and the loopback ties
//! are checked first, which is dev's own order: an internal tie replaces the
//! wire, so whatever is on the wire does not get the frame.
//!
//! SPDR MOVES A WHOLE FRAME OR NOTHING. dev clocks a frame on any store to
//! the data port and serves the holding register on any read of it, so a
//! driver taking a 32-bit frame in two halfword loads ate the frame on the
//! first and starved on the second, and one pushing it back in two halfword
//! stores clocked two frames out of the halves. Here an access that cannot
//! carry the frame SPCMD0 selects, or that names a lane above the bottom of
//! the register, is refused and counted: no part frame is clocked and the
//! receive register keeps what it holds. SPCR2 and SPSRC are bags of lines
//! and still merge; see spi_frame.zig for the rule.
//!
//! SPCR2 IS LOCKED WHILE THE CHANNEL RUNS. Both drivers in the firmware
//! tree say the hardware only honors a store to SPCR2 while SPCR.SPE is
//! clear, in the same words and against the same page, and both reach it
//! from a path whose precondition is that SPCR reads zero. dev takes the
//! store whatever SPE says, so a driver that asks for the internal tie
//! after starting the channel gets one here and bare pins on the bench.
//! Here such a store lands on nothing and is counted; see
//! spi_enable_lock.zig. SPCMD0 is deliberately NOT locked with it: the same
//! tree calls SPCMD0 SPE-restricted once, in a prose aside, but
//! internal_apply_bit_width rewrites SPCMD0.SPB on every transfer with SPE
//! standing and the frame widths the corpus moves depend on that taking
//! effect, so the aside is not evidence enough to refuse it.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: SPBR and BRDV, the bit rate, which a
//! headless run has no clock to show; SPSSR slave select; and the
//! mode-fault, overrun and parity errors.
//! The rest of the window is shadowed so a read-modify-write survives, and
//! never read.
