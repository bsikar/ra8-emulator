//! The fault status words, bit by bit: what CFSR and HFSR can say.
//!
//! CFSR at 0xE000_ED28 is three status registers in one word (DDI0553
//! D1.2.11): MMFSR in the low byte for MemManage, BFSR in the next byte for
//! BusFault, UFSR in the top half for UsageFault. HFSR at 0xE000_ED2C says
//! why a HardFault was taken (D1.2.12). Every bit in both is set by the
//! core when the fault happens and cleared by the firmware writing a one
//! to it.
//!
//! Each core has its own pair, reached through its own PPB, so a fault on
//! CPU1 never shows in CPU0's CFSR. Today the emulator sets only the
//! MemManage bits an MPU-refused access raises (src/periph/mpu/) and
//! HFSR.FORCED when that fault escalates. This file is the one table every
//! later cause is set from and decoded by, so a cause is named once and a
//! handler's dump and the run report read the word the same way.
