//! SRAM controller: the ECC decoder self-test and the error status it latches.
//!
//! The control window sits at 0x4000_2000 (ra8_sram_regs.h, ra8_sram.c). Four
//! banks each carry a one-byte SRAMCRn at 0x10 + 4*bank, and the errors they
//! find land in the 16-bit SRAMESR at 0x40, two slots per bank: slot 0 is the
//! corrected single-bit error, slot 1 the uncorrectable double-bit one. The
//! address that faulted is parked in SRAMEAR[bank][slot] from 0x50, and a
//! write to SRAMESCLR at 0x48 clears whichever slots its mask names.
//!
//! On-chip SRAM is host memory here, not an MMIO hook, so the emulator never
//! sees the corrupted syndrome go in and cannot tell a one-bit fault from a
//! two-bit one. Both slots for the bank are latched together. That is dev's
//! own modelling decision and it is kept: it is enough for ra8_sram_self_test
//! to report a caught fault from either injection, which is the detection,
//! reporting and clear plumbing the demo is there to prove.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_sram.c on dev, with two things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! SRAMESR IS WHAT THE DECODER FOUND, NOT A REGISTER FIRMWARE FILLS IN. dev
//! takes a store to SRAMESR and drops the value straight into the status
//! word, so an image can write 0x0003 and read back two caught errors on a
//! bank whose self-test never ran. That is the whole claim a fault-injection
//! demo exists to make, provable on dev without injecting anything. Here a
//! store to SRAMESR raises nothing: it is refused and counted, the way POEG
//! refuses a store to PIDF. The flags are set by the self-test and by
//! inject(), the seam a real fault source comes in through, and cleared by
//! SRAMESCLR, which is the only write on this block that moves them.
//!
//! THE SELF-TEST IS THREE PHASES, NOT ONE EDGE. dev's own file comment names
//! the sequence ra8_sram_self_test drives per bank: write (0x08), then bypass
//! (0x80), then verify (0x1C), with the data line corrupted while in bypass.
//! Its code only watches the last edge, so a bank driven straight to bypass
//! and then verify, never having run the write phase that puts the bad
//! syndrome in, latches an error it never earned. Here the bank walks the
//! three phases in order and a verify that did not follow a write-then-bypass
//! latches nothing.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: SRAMPRCR's key and protect bits. The real
//! controller refuses a SRAMCRn write while the register is locked, and no
//! header for this part is in this tree to say which key value opens it, so
//! guessing one would turn a lock nothing here can check into a lock every
//! image fails. SRAMPRCR, SRAMWTSC and SRAMECCRGNn are shadowed, so a
//! read-modify-write of them survives, and never interpreted. A narrow access
//! only touches the bytes it names, which is the discipline every block here
//! follows; with four banks the status word never reaches its high byte, so
//! no image can tell the difference today.
