//! The MAX17048-class fuel gauge on the carrier's I2C line, 7-bit address
//! 0x36, and the battery state the run gives it.
//!
//! The part is a file of big-endian sixteen-bit registers behind a byte
//! pointer: a transfer names a register, then a word goes down high byte
//! first or a word comes back. A battery monitor reads VCELL, SOC and CRATE
//! and reports a percentage and a direction from them.
//!
//! dev carried this as a flat 256-byte file that took a byte anywhere, so a
//! driver could store its own state-of-charge over the gauge's and read the
//! number back as a measurement, a read starting on an odd address handed
//! back half of one register and half of the next, and the power-on-reset
//! command landed in the file and did nothing at all.
