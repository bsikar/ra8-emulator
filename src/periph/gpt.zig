//! GPT: the PWM timer, with a period that wraps and a count that stays inside it.
//!
//! Fourteen channels of a 32-bit saw up-counter at 0x4032_2000
//! (ra8_gpt_regs.h). Firmware loads GTPR, starts the channel through GTSTR
//! or GTCR.CST, and then either samples GTCNT to prove the timer is moving or
//! waits on the GPT0 overflow interrupt. Both need a count that really
//! advances, so the channel carries live state rather than a shadow.
//!
//!   GTSTR (+0x04)  software start, bit 0
//!   GTSTP (+0x08)  software stop, bit 0
//!   GTCLR (+0x0C)  software clear, bit 0
//!   GTCR  (+0x2C)  CST bit 0 gates the count
//!   GTST  (+0x3C)  status; TCFPO bit 6 is the overflow
//!   GTCNT (+0x48)  the counter
//!   GTPR  (+0x64)  the period the counter wraps at
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_timer.c on dev, which models the GPT and AGT
//! families together. Three things that model does not do.
//!
//! A FULL-RANGE PERIOD STILL OVERFLOWS. dev tests `(cnt + step) <= period` in
//! 32-bit arithmetic, so a channel with GTPR = 0xFFFF_FFFF has the sum wrap
//! before the comparison and takes the in-range branch every time: TCFPO is
//! never set and the GPT0 event is never raised, so an image using the whole
//! 32-bit range polls a flag that cannot arrive. The sum is computed wide
//! here and a wrap is a wrap at any period.
//!
//! THE COUNT STAYS INSIDE THE PERIOD. dev wraps by subtracting the period
//! once, so a period shorter than one chunk's advance (0x4001) leaves GTCNT
//! reading a value LARGER than GTPR, which silicon cannot produce, and counts
//! one overflow where the hardware had dozens. A driver computing duty from
//! GTCNT against GTPR gets a ratio above one. The advance is reduced modulo
//! the period span here and every wrap inside the chunk is counted.
//!
//! THE WINDOW KEEPS WHAT WAS WRITTEN. dev answers 0 to every offset outside
//! the seven it interprets and drops the stores, so GTIOR, GTSSR, GTBER and
//! the rest read back zero and a driver that verifies its own output setup
//! fails on the readback. Everything uninterpreted is shadowed per channel,
//! and every register takes a narrow store on its own byte lane instead of
//! dev's whole-word assignment, where a halfword store to the low half of
//! GTPR wrote the period and a store to the high half vanished.
//!
//! KEPT FROM DEV DELIBERATELY: GTPR = 0 counts to 0xFFFF rather than standing
//! still, so a channel started before its period is loaded still moves;
//! GTST clears by writing the value back with the target bits zero, so
//! firmware can only clear a flag, never raise one; and only channel 0 raises
//! an event, because GPT0's overflow is the one number this tree carries.
//!
//! ONE EVENT PER BOUNDARY: several wraps inside one chunk are one interrupt
//! here. The count of them is reported, but they are not stacked into a
//! backlog that would fire long after the counter moved on.
//!
//! THE COUNT SOURCE lives in src/periph/gpt_clock.zig: GTCR's TPCS field
//! picks the divider a channel counts at, so a channel slowed to PCLKD/1024
//! really is a thousand times slower than an undivided one instead of every
//! channel counting at the same rate.
//!
//! COMPARE MATCH lives in src/periph/gpt_compare.zig: GTCCRA (+0x4C) and
//! GTCCRB (+0x50) are compared against the count rather than shadowed, and a
//! crossing raises GTST.TCFA or TCFB. Everything that file does not claim is
//! still shadowed.
//!
//! THE COUNTER MODE lives in src/periph/gpt_mode.zig: GTCR's MD field picks
//! the shape a channel counts in, so a triangle channel rises to the period
//! and falls back to zero instead of sawing, and a one-shot channel stops
//! itself at the period instead of wrapping forever.
//!
//! THE BUFFERED COMPARE lives in src/periph/gpt_buffer.zig: GTBER (+0x40)
//! says whether a channel reloads GTCCRA and GTCCRB from their buffer
//! registers at the end of a cycle, so a duty the HAL parks through
//! `ra8_gpt_duty_cycle_set` arrives on the next cycle instead of never
//! arriving at all. This file's note used to say a buffered duty took effect
//! at once; it did not take effect, because nothing read the buffer.
//!
//! THE WRITE PROTECTION lives in src/periph/gpt_lock.zig: GTWP (+0x00)
//! carries a password in its upper byte and WP in bit 0, and the HAL
//! brackets every channel it touches between the two keys, so a channel the
//! HAL has finished with is shut and a store that skips the key is dropped
//! instead of landing.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the per-source interrupt enables in
//! GTINTAD, so channel 0's overflow always raises and a compare match never
//! does.
