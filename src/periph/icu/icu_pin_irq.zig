//! Host-driven pin edges reaching the ICU (RA8EMU-375).
//!
//! The user switches are driven from the host stream (RA8EMU-344), which
//! moves the pin but cannot pend anything on its own: on the part a pin only
//! feeds its IRQ channel while its PmnPFS.ISEL bit is set (HUM Ch 20,
//! PmnPFS b14), and the channel only fires on the sense IRQCRi.IRQMD picked
//! (HUM Ch 14.2.12): 00 falling, 01 rising, 10 both edges, 11 low level.
//!
//! So the host side queues each real level change as an Edge, and the board
//! boundary asks this file whether that edge fires before raising the
//! channel's event through the usual event path (links, DTC, then the ICU).
//!
//! LOW LEVEL is taken as a raise when the pin goes low. The IR latch then
//! holds the line until the handler clears it; a level still held after
//! that clear is not raised again. Nothing in the corpus selects low level
//! (the board code picks falling edge), so this stays the simple reading.
