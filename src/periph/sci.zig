//! SCI_B: the serial channels, so a console print ends instead of spinning.
//!
//! The RA8D2 puts ten SCI_B channels at 0x4035_8000, 0x100 apart (HUM Ch 29,
//! ra8_sci_regs.h, the 32-bit-register variant). The EK-RA8D2 console is SCI8
//! on PD02/PD03, and it is the block every non-display example reaches first:
//! `ra8_sci_putc_polling` writes a byte and then waits on CSR.TDRE, and
//! `ra8_sci_getc_polling` waits on CSR.RDRF. Until now the window fell through
//! to the sparse register file, where a status poll gets alternating stand-in
//! values rather than a transmitter that drains, so console output was a race
//! against the instruction budget instead of a result. Ported from
//! board_periph_sci.c on dev.
//!
//!   RDR   (+0x00) receive data, RDAT[7:0]
//!   TDR   (+0x04) transmit data, TDAT[7:0]
//!   CCR0  (+0x08) RE, TE and the three interrupt enables
//!   CSR   (+0x48) TDRE, TEND, RDRF, RXDMON
//!   FRSR  (+0x50) receive-FIFO status
//!   FTSR  (+0x54) transmit-FIFO status
//!   CFCLR (+0x68) common flag clear, write-1-to-clear
//!   FFCLR (+0x70) FIFO flag clear, write-1-to-clear
//!
//! The transmitter is always drained here: there is no baud-rate clock in an
//! instruction-stepped emulator, so a byte written to TDR is captured and gone,
//! and TDRE/TEND read as set. The receiver is a host-fed ring per channel, so
//! RDRF is a fact about queued bytes rather than a value a driver wrote.
//!
//! THE SIMPLE LIN HALF OF THE WINDOW ANSWERS TOO. XCR0/XCR1/XCR2, XSR0/XSR1
//! and XFCLR sit in the same channel window and used to fall through the
//! `else` arms below: every store dropped, every read zero. XCR1.TCST is a
//! self-clearing strobe that starts a break field, so reading it back clear
//! is exactly what ra8_sci_lin_send_break polls for, and the call returned
//! success for a break that never happened. The rule and its evidence live
//! in src/periph/sci_lin.zig.
//!
//! RDR AND TDR ARE A DATA PORT, AND THE PORT IS THE BYTE RDAT/TDAT SITS IN.
//! An access that does not name byte 0 of the word carries no character in
//! either direction. The store side always said so. The read side did not:
//! it popped the receive ring for any access landing anywhere in RDR, so a
//! driver loading one of the bytes above RDAT ate a received character, was
//! handed zero for it, and the run counted the byte as delivered while the
//! next read of RDAT starved. Both directions are refused and counted now,
//! and a refused read leaves the ring holding what it had, so the driver can
//! come back with a load that names the data.
