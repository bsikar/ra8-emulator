//! CPSCU: the chip-level security attribution words for the bus masters,
//! the master MPUs and the second CPU, and the gate in front of them.
//!
//! The CPSCU window at 0x4000_8000 carries the attribution the Secure boot
//! writes before it hands anything to the Non-Secure world. Two of its words
//! already have a home: IPCSAR and IPCPAR live in ipc_attr.zig, because they
//! attribute the mailbox channels and the mailbox is what reports them. This
//! file is the rest of what the firmware in this tree touches: the three bus
//! controller words, the two master-MPU words, and the CPU attribution word.
//!
//! WHAT THE FIRMWARE DOES WITH THEM. cpu1_pingpong_ipc's trustzone_init.c
//! writes all six in one protected scope, immediately before it releases the
//! second core, and says why in its own comment: "With these at cold-reset
//! defaults the M33's view of NS peripherals is gated by the chip's bus
//! arbiter; the CPU1 SAU init in cpu1_main.c alone is not sufficient to reach
//! IPCSAR-attributed channels."
//!
//! WHY THEY ARE MODELLED RATHER THAN LEFT TO THE SPARSE BUS, which is the
//! same argument pscu.zig makes for PSARB..PSARE next door. An unmodelled
//! address is answered out of an unmodelled cell, and that cell alternates 0
//! and 0xFFFF_FFFF on repeated reads. For an attribution word those two
//! values are "everything Secure" and "everything given away", the two
//! opposite answers, and which one a driver gets is a function of how often
//! the address has been touched. No image in this tree reads one back yet,
//! so what the run gains today is the PRC4 gate below and a report that says
//! what the boot delegated; the determinism is for the image that does.
//!
//! EVERY WORD IS GATED BY PRCR_S.PRC4, the same gate ipc_attr.zig holds and
//! the reason this is a block rather than a shadow. A store issued with PRC4
//! shut is discarded by silicon with no fault and no status bit. The
//! firmware opens PRC4 and PRC1 together across the whole release sequence
//! for exactly that reason, so the happy path is unaffected and what the
//! gate catches is a firmware that forgot.
//!
//! THE RESERVED CHECK RUNS BEFORE THE GATE, the cut spi.zig already made
//! between a malformed access and a disabled channel: an offset that is not
//! a register is not a register whether or not PRC4 was open, so it is
//! counted as reserved and never as refused.
//!
//! RESET IS ZERO ON ALL SIX. The active-high convention across this window
//! is that a set bit is the permissive state, so all-zero is "everything
//! Secure", which is the cold-reset state ra8_dual_core.h names for the one
//! word it talks about ("CPUSAR.CPUSA1 defaults Secure") and the same reset
//! pscu.zig records for the peripheral attribution words.
//!
//! RECORDED, NOT ENFORCED, the line the SAU and IPC attribution models both
//! hold. Nothing here refuses an access because a master was left Secure:
//! this board has no bus arbiter and no master MPU to refuse on behalf of,
//! and a refusal invented out of a register value would be a register file
//! pretending to be a decision.
