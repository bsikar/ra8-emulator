//! SDHI0: the SD host controller, and the card commands it will actually
//! pass on.
//!
//! The block sits at 0x4025_2000 with a 0x200 window (ra8_sdhi_regs.h,
//! ra8_sdhi.c). A native-SD image drives it in two halves. First the SD
//! Physical Layer identification, CMD0 -> CMD8 -> ACMD41 -> CMD2 -> CMD3 ->
//! CMD9 -> CMD7, each one a write to SD_CMD with SD_ARG already loaded, each
//! one polled for SD_INFO1.RSPEND. Then the data phase: CMD17/18 arm a read
//! and CMD24/25 arm a write, and each SD_BUF0 access moves one 32-bit word
//! of a 512-byte block.
//!
//! The card itself, its blocks and the state it is in, lives next door in
//! sdhi_card.zig. This file owns the window, the command engine and the
//! FIFO.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_sdhi.c on dev, with five things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! A BLOCK COMMAND NEEDS A SELECTED CARD. dev answers R1 "ready" to CMD17
//! from reset and hands over block data, so an image that skips the
//! identification sequence reads real-looking blocks on dev and reads
//! nothing on silicon. The card walks idle -> ready -> ident -> stby ->
//! tran here, and a data command from anywhere but tran is answered with
//! ILLEGAL_COMMAND, arms no data phase, and is counted.
//!
//! THE RESPONSE AND STATUS REGISTERS ARE THE CONTROLLER'S. dev stores
//! anywhere in the window, SD_RSP10..76 and SD_INFO1/2 included, so
//! firmware can write its own card response and read it back as though a
//! card sent it, and can raise RSPEND on itself. A store to SD_RSP10..76 is
//! refused and counted here, the CETCR and SRAMESR pattern. SD_INFO1/2 keep
//! the driver's convention, which dev does not implement either: a flag is
//! acknowledged by writing a zero to it and a one leaves it where it was.
//!
//! SOFT_RST HOLDS THE PART IN RESET. dev clears its engine on both writes
//! of the driver's 0-then-1 sequence and runs commands either way. Bit 0
//! clear is reset asserted here: the FIFO and the flags are cleared and a
//! command issued while it is asserted does nothing and is counted.
//!
//! SD_BUF0 IS A 32-BIT PORT. dev pops or pushes a whole word for an access
//! of any width, so a byte read of the FIFO swallows four bytes of the
//! block and the transfer silently runs short. A narrow access is refused
//! and counted.
//!
//! A FIFO TOUCHED WITH NO DATA PHASE IS COUNTED, and a narrow write only
//! touches the bytes it names: dev returns 0 to a read with nothing armed
//! and swallows the write, so an image whose command failed drains a block
//! of zeros and calls it data, and dev's `regs[off / 4] = value` makes the
//! driver's halfword store to SD_CMD wipe the two bytes above it.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED AND NOT GUESSED: every SDHI interrupt (dev raises none and
//! no header here gives the event numbers), the SD_INFO2 error bits beyond
//! the buffer flags, SD_DMAEN transfers, the clock and timeout fields, and
//! CMD6. They are shadowed so a read-modify-write survives, never read.
