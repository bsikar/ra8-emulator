//! The width and bit order of an SPI_B frame, read out of SPCMD0.
//!
//! SPDR carries a word; how much of that word leaves the channel is
//! SPCMD0's business. SPB[20:16] holds N-1 for an N-bit frame
//! (ra8_spi_regs.h, HUM Ch 43.2.7 p 2893) and the header names exactly
//! three encodings the driver programmes: 0x07 for 8 bits, 0x0F for 16 and
//! 0x1F for 32. LSBF (bit 12) decides which end of the frame goes out
//! first.
//!
//! The driver depends on both. `internal_apply_bit_width` in ra8_spi_b.c
//! rewrites SPB before a transfer and then pushes whole uint16_t or
//! uint32_t units into SPDR, and `internal_spcmd` sets LSBF from the
//! caller's config. A model that clocks eight bits whatever SPB says hands
//! a 16-bit transfer back its low byte and loses the other half, which is
//! what this file exists to stop.
//!
//! AN UNNAMED SPB ENCODING KEEPS THE EIGHT-BIT DEFAULT. HUM lists more of
//! the field than the header carries, and inventing widths for the values
//! the tree does not name would be making the numbers up. Anything outside
//! the three named encodings counts as unnamed, leaves the frame at eight
//! bits, and is reported, the way the AGT does with a count source it does
//! not recognise. A cleared field is the exception: SPCMD0 reads zero out
//! of reset, so an image that never programmes it has not selected a bad
//! width, it has selected nothing, and the default stands without a
//! complaint on the report.
//!
//! LSB-FIRST IS ONLY VISIBLE ON THE WIRE. A loopback tie shifts out and
//! back in at the same end, so the word returns unchanged whichever way it
//! went. A device on the line clocks MSB-first, so a frame sent LSB-first
//! reaches it reversed and what it drives comes back reversed again. That
//! is the model's own reading of a headless wire, stated rather than
//! implied.
