//! The GLCDC's colour lookup tables: where a CLUT-mode pixel's colour
//! actually comes from.
//!
//! The window opens with four 1 KiB CLUT planes (ra8_glcdc_regs.h, HUM Ch 63
//! p 3730), two per graphics layer, 256 ARGB8888 entries each:
//!
//!   0x0000  GR1_CLUT0[256]
//!   0x0400  GR1_CLUT1[256]
//!   0x0800  GR2_CLUT0[256]
//!   0x0C00  GR2_CLUT1[256]
//!
//! A layer has two planes so a driver can fill the one it is not showing and
//! swap at a line boundary; GRn_CLUTINT.SEL picks which plane the fetch unit
//! reads. dev models none of this: its snoop takes eleven offsets and the
//! CLUT planes are not among them, so every CLUT entry a driver wrote fell
//! into the sparse register file and the index bytes in the framebuffer were
//! hashed as if they were colours.
