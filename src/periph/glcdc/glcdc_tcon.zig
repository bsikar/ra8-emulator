//! GLCDC TCON: the panel's own timing, and which pin carries which sync.
//!
//! The mixer composites onto a panel, and until now this model had to guess
//! how big that panel was: it took the furthest a programmed layer reached.
//! The panel is not the layer. TCON is where the driver writes the timing it
//! read out of the board's panel table (ra8_glcdc.c internal_program_tcon),
//! so the active area, the sync widths and the back porches are all here in
//! registers, and a layer smaller than the panel leaves background around it
//! rather than shrinking the glass.
//!
//! The four STxx2 registers are pin configuration, not timing: each one
//! drives one LCD_TCONn pin, picking the internal signal that reaches it
//! (SEL [2:0]) and whether it is inverted on the way out (INV, bit 4). The
//! in-tree driver routes VSYNC to TCON0 active-low, HSYNC to TCON1 active-low
//! via STVB, and DE to TCON2 active-high; a panel wired for the other
//! polarity shows a picture on the bench and nothing on the glass, which is
//! the kind of thing worth having in the report.
//!
//! dev's board_periph_glcdc.c snoops eleven offsets and none of them are in
//! this block, so every one of these writes went into a shadow word nobody
//! read.
