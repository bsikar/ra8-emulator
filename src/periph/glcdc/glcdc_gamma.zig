//! GLCDC gamma correction: the three per-channel piecewise-linear blocks.
//!
//! Each colour channel gets its own 64-byte block (GAM[0]=R at +0x1300,
//! GAM[1]=G at +0x1340, GAM[2]=B at +0x1380, HUM Ch 63 p 3789-3793). A block
//! is eight LUT registers packing two 11-bit gains each, and eight AREA
//! registers packing two 10-bit thresholds each: sixteen segments over the
//! 10-bit output pipeline, each with its own slope. The global switch
//! GAMSW.GAMON lives in the OUT block, not here.
//!
//! The in-tree driver (ra8_glcdc_gamma.c) writes all sixteen gains and all
//! sixteen thresholds through this packing, then flips GAMON. dev snoops
//! none of it: a panel corrected for its own transfer curve came out of that
//! tree with the uncorrected colours in the witness.
