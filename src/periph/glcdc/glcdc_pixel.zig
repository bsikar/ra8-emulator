//! Turning a fetched framebuffer pixel into a colour.
//!
//! FLM6.FORMAT names eight packings (HUM Ch 63 Table 63.11). Five carry the
//! colour in the pixel itself; three carry an index into the layer's CLUT.
//! dev has the eight codes as an enum and uses them for exactly two things,
//! a bytes-per-pixel number and a name in the report, so a framebuffer's
//! contents were never decoded at all.
//!
//! The bytes-per-pixel number is where that bites. dev rounds CLUT4 and
//! CLUT1 up to one byte per pixel and then recovers the panel width as
//! `stride / bytes`, so a 4-bit layer reads back half as wide as it is and a
//! 1-bit layer an eighth. The width is in the report, and it is wrong for
//! every sub-byte layer dev has ever printed. Bits, not bytes, is the unit
//! that works for all eight.
