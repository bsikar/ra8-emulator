//! GLCDC SYSCNT: the panel clock, the state detections, and the status a
//! driver polls.
//!
//! Everything upstream of here decides what a pixel looks like. This block
//! decides whether a frame happens at all, and what the driver is told about
//! it afterwards. SYSCNT.PANEL_CLK gates the pixel clock: the in-tree driver
//! programs CLKSEL = LCDCLK, CLKEN and a divider in `ra8_glcdc_init` before
//! it touches a single timing register (ra8_glcdc.c, the PANEL_CLK write),
//! and a controller whose clock never started scans nothing however well its
//! layers are programmed.
//!
//! The other four registers are one status word seen from four sides:
//! DTCTEN arms a detection, INTEN lets an armed detection reach the
//! interrupt controller, STMON reports what has been detected, and STCLR
//! takes it back down. `ra8_glcdc_start` writes DTCTEN = 1 as its step 3,
//! naming the bit VPOSDTC, the line-detect source a display driver waits a
//! frame on.
//!
//! dev's board_periph_glcdc.c snoops eleven offsets and none of them are in
//! this block, so on that tree STMON read back whatever word had last been
//! written to it, which is zero: firmware that waits for a frame to land
//! waits forever, and firmware that clears a status it never had is told it
//! worked. The panel clock is not read there either, so a framebuffer was
//! hashed and reported as a picture with the clock still gated off.
