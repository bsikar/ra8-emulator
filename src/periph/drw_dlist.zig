//! The DRW display list: the same register writes, fetched from memory
//! instead of taken from the CPU (HUM Ch 62.6, TES D/AVE list format).
//!
//! Split out of drw.zig because it is a different thing: that file is a
//! register window and a rasterizer, this is a reader walking words in
//! memory and saying which register each one is for. It decides nothing
//! about pixels; drw.zig executes what comes back exactly as it executes a
//! CPU write, so an ORIGIN entry in a list triggers a render the same way.
//!
//! The encoding is the one the ra8_drw builder emits and the bench confirmed
//! for issue #247: a one-index tag (bit 15 set, the register index in the
//! low byte) followed by one value word, and end-of-list words whose low
//! byte is 0xFF with the argument in byte 1. Multi-index packing was never
//! observed, so the reader stops on it rather than guessing.
