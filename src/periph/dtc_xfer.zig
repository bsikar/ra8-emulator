//! The DTC descriptor: one Transfer Information block, as the controller
//! reads it out of memory and writes it back.
//!
//! The DTC keeps nothing about a transfer in its own registers. DTCVBR points
//! at a table of pointers, one per ICU slot, and each entry points at a
//! sixteen-byte TI block in RAM holding the mode word, the two addresses and
//! the two counts. The controller reads that block when an event activates
//! it, moves what the mode word says to move, and writes the block back with
//! the addresses and counts where they now stand, so the next activation
//! carries on where this one stopped (HUM Ch 18.2 p 790, r_dtc_xfer_info_t).
//!
//! The descriptor gets its own file so src/periph/dtc.zig stays a register
//! window and an activation path, the same split drw.zig and drw_blend.zig
//! have.
