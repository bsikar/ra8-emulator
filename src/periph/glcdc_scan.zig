//! dev stops one step short of this. Its GLCDC block is registered
//! `observe = true`, snoops eleven register offsets, recovers a descriptor,
//! and folds an FNV-1a-32 over the raw framebuffer bytes at report time. Two
//! things follow from hashing bytes instead of pixels. A CLUT-mode layer is
//! hashed as index bytes, so the palette a driver spent its init writing is
//! not in the witness at all and a run with no palette hashes the same as a
//! run with one. And the hash is over the fetch, not over what reaches the
//! panel: a layer whose framebuffer runs off the end of its RAM window, or
//! one with the output stage off, hashes like any other.
//!
//! Here the scan decodes each pixel to ARGB8888 through the format and the
//! layer's palette, hashes the decoded colours, and refuses the cases that
//! are not a picture.
