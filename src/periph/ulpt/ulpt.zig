//! ULPT: the low-power timer a sleeping part wakes itself on.
//!
//! Two channels of a 32-bit reloading down-counter at 0x4022_0000, clocked
//! from the LOCO-derived ULPTLCLK so they keep running through Software
//! Standby (HUM Ch 25 p 1187). That is the whole point of the block: the
//! deep-idle images arm a channel, drop into standby on WFI, and rely on the
//! underflow to cancel standby through the ICU. Without a model the underflow
//! never happens, the registered ISR never runs, and the wake count stays
//! zero while the run burns its budget in the wait loop.
//!
//!   ULPTCNT (+0x00, 32b)  counter; a write seeds the count and the reload
//!   ULPTCMA (+0x04, 32b)  compare match A
//!   ULPTCMB (+0x08, 32b)  compare match B
//!   ULPTCR  (+0x0C, 8b)   TSTART b0, TCSTF b1 (RO), TSTOP b2 (W), TUNDF b5
//!   ULPTMR1 (+0x0D, 8b)   TMOD, TEDGPL, TCK count source
//!   ULPTMR2 (+0x0E, 8b)   the prescaler in front of the counter
//!   ULPTIOC (+0x10, 8b)   I/O control
//!
//! ULPTCR shares the AGT's AGTCR layout (HUM Ch 25.2.1 p 1190, mirroring
//! Ch 24.2.6 p 1175), so a TCSTF poll and a TUNDF poll both read real state.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_ulpt.c on dev, with three departures, all of them
//! places where firmware that misbehaves on the bench passes there.
//!
//! One: dev drops TSTOP on the floor. Its ULPTCR write keeps the TSTART bit
//! and nothing else, so the forced stop the driver issues as TSTART|TSTOP
//! (0x05) leaves the channel running there and stops it on silicon: the
//! emulator keeps waking a part the firmware believes it parked. Here TSTOP
//! wins over TSTART in the same write, clears TCSTF, and holds the count.
//!
//! Two: dev raises the underflow event on the RISING EDGE of TUNDF only, so a
//! periodic image that never clears the flag gets exactly one wake there and
//! wakes every period on the bench: the run hangs in the emulator and the
//! failure looks like the ISR, not the flag. The interrupt is requested at
//! every underflow here, and TUNDF is separately sticky until written zero.
//!
//! Three: dev steps every channel by one constant per chunk whatever the mode
//! registers say, so shortening or lengthening the configured period changes
//! nothing. There is no absolute time here either, but ULPTMR2's prescaler is
//! at least ORDERED: the step is scaled down by the selected divider, so a
//! slower configured source really does underflow less often.
//!
//! Four: neither tree compared the compare values. ULPTCMA and ULPTCMB were
//! storage on both, so a count could run straight past one and nothing said
//! so. The comparison lives in ulpt_compare.zig now, and the flags it raises
//! are AGTCR's TCMAF and TCMBF, which ULPTCR mirrors.
