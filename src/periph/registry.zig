//! The peripheral window and the blocks that live in it.
//!
//! The RA8D2 puts every Renesas peripheral in one window at 0x40000000, with a
//! Non-secure alias 0x10000000 above it. Firmware reaches that window long
//! before it reaches anything interesting, so the bus has to answer every
//! access: a modelled block answers for its own range, and everything else
//! falls through to a sparse register file that remembers what was written.
//!
//! The sparse fallback is not laziness, it is what lets unported firmware get
//! anywhere. A driver writes a control register and reads it back to check the
//! write took, so reads return the last value written. A driver then spins on a
//! status bit waiting for "ready", and a register nothing models would spin
//! forever, so an address read repeatedly with nothing written to it alternates
//! between zero and all-ones: a poll for either polarity of a single bit falls
//! through instead of hanging.
