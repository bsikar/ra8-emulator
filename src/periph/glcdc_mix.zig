//! The panel mixer: the background colour, the graphics layers stacked on

//!
//! One framebuffer is not a panel. The block composites the background
//! plane, then graphics 1, then graphics 2 on top of it, each layer sitting
//! in its own rectangle and reaching the panel only as far as its AB1
//! DISPSEL, its chroma key and its alpha allow. dev picks a single layer and
//! hashes it: GR1 when GR1.FLMRD is set, GR2 otherwise. An overlay over a
//! background image, which is the whole reason there are two layers, has
//! never been in a witness from that tree at all.
