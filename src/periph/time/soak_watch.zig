//! Firmware-side corruption a soak watches (RA8EMU-619).
//!
//! A `--run-for` soak keeps a short list of words the firmware should never
//! change: a ThreadX thread's stack-canary fill, a heap guard word. Each
//! boundary reads them once, beside the latched-fault check, and the first
//! word found changed is the soak's event. An empty list reads nothing, so a
//! run with nothing to watch costs nothing. An unreadable word is not a
//! change: the run report has the same view of a word it cannot read.
