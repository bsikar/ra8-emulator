//! When each core's SysTick next wraps, in virtual nanoseconds
//! (RA8EMU-515, slice 3).
//!
//! A SysTick tick is a core clock cycle, and each core is clocked through
//! its own SCKDIVCR2 nibble, so the same CVR wraps at different times on
//! CPU0 and CPU1. A counter reaches zero on its CVR-th tick, or a full
//! period (RVR + 1 ticks) after it was left at zero (clocks.wrap,
//! RA8EMU-657), and that tick ends ticks * 1e9 / hz ns from now. The answer is rounded up to
//! the first whole nanosecond the wrap has happened by, the same instant
//! TimeBase.cyclesUntil counts to.
//!
//! The run already charges each core's SysTick its own instructions, and
//! CPU1's turn is sized by core_rate.turn, so this is a reading of where the
//! wrap falls, not a second clock: nothing here moves a counter or touches
//! the event queue.
