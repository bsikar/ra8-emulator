//! The pacer as the board holds it (RA8EMU-181, slice 2).
//!
//! The run loop belongs to the dual-core lane, so pacing hangs off the board's
//! chunk boundary instead (src/board/boundary.zig), which every stretch of a
//! run already passes through with virtual time freshly advanced. Nothing is
//! attached by default, so an unpaced run does exactly what it did before.
//!
//! A boundary comes every few tens of microseconds of virtual time. Asking the
//! host to sleep that often would cost more than the sleeps, so the pacer is
//! only consulted once at least `step_ns` of virtual time has gone by: at 1x
//! that is at most a thousand checks a second, and a 10 ms timer still lands
//! within a millisecond of the wall clock.
