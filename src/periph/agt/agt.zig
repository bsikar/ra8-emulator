//! AGT: the interval timer, with a stop that stops and a compare that matches.
//!
//! Ten channels of a 16-bit reloading down-counter at 0x4022_1000
//! (ra8_agt_regs.h, 16-bit view). Firmware writes a period into AGT, sets
//! AGTCR.TSTART, and from there either polls AGTCR or waits on the AGT0
//! combined interrupt. The counter has to really move for any of that to
//! finish, so this block keeps a live count rather than a register shadow.
//!
//!   AGT    (+0x00, 16b)  counter; a write seeds the count and the reload
//!   AGTCMA (+0x02, 16b)  compare match A
//!   AGTCMB (+0x04, 16b)  compare match B
//!   AGTCR  (+0x08, 8b)   TSTART b0, TCSTF b1 (RO), TSTOP b2 (W),
//!                        TUNDF b5, TCMAF b6, TCMBF b7
//!   AGTMR1 (+0x09, 8b)   mode 1
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_timer.c on dev, which models the AGT and GPT
//! families together. Four things that model does not do.
//!
//! TSTOP STOPS THE COUNT. dev's AGTCR write keeps the TSTART bit and nothing
//! else, so the forced stop a driver issues as TSTART|TSTOP (0x05) leaves the
//! channel running there and stops it on silicon: the emulator keeps
//! underflowing a timer the firmware believes it parked. TSTOP wins over
//! TSTART in the same write here, clears TCSTF, and holds the count. This is
//! the same bit ulpt.zig already takes, on the register layout ULPTCR shares
//! with AGTCR (HUM Ch 25.2.1 p 1190, mirroring Ch 24.2.6 p 1175).
//!
//! A COMPARE MATCH MATCHES. dev names TCMAF and TCMBF in its own bit
//! enumeration, its underflow comment promises to raise TCMAF, and the code
//! raises neither, so an image that waits on compare match A waits forever.
//! A count that passes a compare value sets its flag here and is counted.
//!
//! A COUNTER WRITE NEEDS THE COUNT STOPPED. dev seeds the counter and the
//! reload whenever asked, so an image that re-periods a running channel works
//! there and loses the write on the bench. Refused and counted here, the way
//! the calendar refuses a counter write with RCR2.START set.
//!
//! THE WINDOW KEEPS WHAT WAS WRITTEN. dev answers 0 to every offset outside
//! the five it interprets and drops the stores, so AGTMR2, AGTIOC and the
//! rest read back zero and a driver that verifies its own mode setup fails on
//! its first readback. Everything uninterpreted is shadowed per channel with
//! narrow-write merge.
//!
//! A COMPARE MATCHES ONLY WHEN AGTCMSR ARMED IT. This model used to stand a
//! rule of its own in for the register it could not read: a compare value of
//! zero counted as unarmed, everything else as armed. agt_compare.zig now
//! reads TCMEA and TCMEB out of AGTCMSR at +0x0E, so a side the driver never
//! enabled raises nothing and a side it parked at 0xFFFF is not mistaken for
//! an armed one. A count that passes a compare value with the function
//! disabled is counted, so the run says what the flag would have been.
//!
//! THE COUNT SOURCE IS THE ONE AGTMR1 SELECTS. That field used to be a
//! shadow byte on both trees, so every channel stepped at one rate whatever
//! a driver asked for. agt_clock.zig now reads TCK out of it: a divided
//! source counts proportionally slower, and AGT1 set to cascade steps on
//! AGT0's underflow instead of on a clock of its own.
//!
//! THE CASCADE'S START ORDER IS VISIBLE. ra8_agt_start_cascade's contract
//! cites the part: "AGT1's TSTART must be set before AGT0's so AGT1 is ready
//! to sample the AGT0 underflow on the very first cycle" (ra8_agt.h, HUM
//! Ch 24.2.4 "AGTCR" p 1167, the count starts in sync with its source).
//! Started the other way round, every AGT0 underflow landing before AGT1's
//! TSTART is gone and the 32-bit value the pair stands for is short by that
//! many for the rest of the run. The arithmetic was already right, since a
//! stopped channel does not advance, and that is the problem: the loss was
//! silent, so a backwards start order read a plausible 32-bit count that was
//! wrong. Counted now, and neither refused nor flagged, as on silicon.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: AGTMR2's own CKS divider, which has an
//! offset in the header and no field table; AGTCMSR's output-enable and
//! polarity bits, which select and invert a pin a headless run has nothing
//! to show on; and the compare-match interrupts, which have event numbers
//! this tree does not carry. Only the AGT0 combined event is raised, on underflow, which is
//! what dev raises too.
