//! The AGT count source: what the counter counts, and how fast.
//!
//! AGTMR1 carries two fields (ra8_agt_regs.h, HUM Ch 24.2.5 p 1168): TMOD in
//! the low three bits, and TCK[2:0] at bit 4 selecting the clock the counter
//! decrements on. The header names four encodings and no others:
//!
//!   000b  PCLKB                 the undivided peripheral clock
//!   001b  PCLKB / 8
//!   011b  PCLKB / 2
//!   101b  AGT0's underflow      AGT1 only, the cascade pair
//!
//! AGTMR1 was a shadow byte here. Firmware wrote it, read it back, and the
//! counter stepped at one rate whatever it said, so a channel a driver had
//! deliberately slowed down underflowed exactly as often as an undivided one
//! and a cascaded AGT1 counted on its own instead of on AGT0. dev's
//! board_periph_timer.c has the same hole and answers zero to the offset
//! besides, so AGTMR1 does not even read back on that tree.
//!
//! There is no absolute time in this model, so a divider cannot be a real
//! frequency. It is ORDERED instead, the way ulpt.zig already treats
//! ULPTMR2: the counts one chunk boundary stands for are scaled down by the
//! selected divider, so divide-by-eight really is eight times slower than
//! undivided and a period that fits in one boundary at PCLKB takes eight at
//! PCLKB/8. That ordering is what an image comparing two channels can see.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the TCK encodings the header does not
//! name (010b, 100b, 110b, 111b, which on the part reach the subclock and
//! LOCO). An unnamed encoding counts undivided rather than being given an
//! invented divisor, and `name()` says it is unknown so the run does not
//! claim to have recognised it. AGTMR2's own CKS divider is not modelled
//! either: the header gives the register its offset and no field table, and
//! the driver writes it zero everywhere.
