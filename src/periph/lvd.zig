//! PVD: the programmable voltage monitors, so a rail check reports the rail.
//!
//! The RA8D2 carries four voltage-detection channels inside the SYSC window
//! (HUM Ch 8 "Programmable Voltage Detection", p 300-316). PVD1 and PVD2 are
//! the "m" series, with a status register and an interrupt path; PVD4 and PVD5
//! are the "n" series, reset-only, with no status register at all. The
//! registers are scattered across three stretches of SYSC rather than sitting
//! in one window, so this block claims three ranges and answers for all of
//! them (ra8_lvd_regs.h, offsets verified there against FSP R_SYSTEM_Type).
//!
//!   0x4001_E0E0 +4    PVD1CR1, PVD1SR, PVD2CR1, PVD2SR
//!   0x4001_EA58 +0x2C PVDmCMPCR and PVDmCR0 for all four channels
//!   0x4001_EB20 +0x18 PVDmFCR for all four, then PVDLR
//!
//! THE RESET BAND AND ITS NEGATION INTERLOCK. RHSEL = 1 needs PVDmCR0.RI
//! already set, and RN = 1 is prohibited while RHSEL = 1 (HUM Ch 8.2.8
//! p 308, Ch 8.2.4 p 305). Both rules, why only m channels are gated and
//! why a standing bit is left alone, live in src/periph/lvd_interlock.zig.
//!
//! THE FILTER DIVIDER IS LOCKED WHILE THE FILTER RUNS. FSAMP only takes a
//! store while that channel's DFDIS is set (HUM Ch 8.2.4 p 305, Ch 8.2.5
//! p 306). The rule, its citation, why a read-modify-write that carries the
//! divider along unchanged is not a violation, and why the matching PVDLVL
//! rule is not modelled yet, all live in src/periph/lvd_field_lock.zig.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_lvd.c on dev, which models the four status bytes
//! and nothing else: it answers every PVDmSR read with MON = above and DET = 0
//! whatever the firmware programmed, and absorbs every status write. So on dev
//! a monitor that was never enabled still reports a healthy rail, a threshold
//! programmed above the supply still reports a healthy rail, and a DET flag can
//! never be observed to latch. The comparator is modelled here instead: the
//! board presents a fixed 3.3 V rail, MON is the comparison against the
//! programmed Vdet, and DET latches on a crossing the firmware caused.
