//! The IT8951 e-paper controller on the SPI line: the word protocol a panel
//! answers, and the difference between a panel that is awake and one the
//! firmware put to sleep.
//!
//! The driver clocks bytes through SPDR and the controller assembles them
//! into 16-bit words MSB first. Every transaction opens with a preamble
//! word: command follows, data follows, or the host is about to read. A read
//! burst is four bytes, a dummy word and then the value, which is what the
//! driver's read_data16 takes. There is no chip select in this tree, so the
//! panel self-frames off those preambles, which is what dev does too.
//!
//! Ported from board_periph_eink.c on dev, with five things that model does
//! not do.
//!
//! A COMMAND NEEDS AN AWAKE PANEL. dev declares SYS_RUN and SLEEP in its own
//! command enum and implements neither, so an image that puts the panel into
//! deep sleep and then loads and refreshes gets a full report there and a
//! blank panel on the bench. Here SLEEP stops the controller answering:
//! every command but SYS_RUN is refused and counted until the firmware wakes
//! it back up.
//!
//! A REGISTER KEEPS WHAT WAS WRITTEN. dev latches the address of a REG_WR
//! and throws the value away, and answers zero to every register read, so a
//! driver that programs a register and reads it back to confirm reads zero
//! forever and cannot tell a dead bus from a working one. Here a written
//! register reads back, and LUTAFSR stays the controller's own: a write to
//! it is refused and counted, and a read of it is always the idle status the
//! display poll is waiting for.
//!
//! A LOAD IS BOUNDED BY THE RECTANGLE IT DECLARED. dev counts pixels for
//! every data word after the geometry and never looks at the width and
//! height it just took, so a stream longer than its own target area reads as
//! a clean load there and overruns the area on silicon. Here the rectangle
//! is latched and a word past it moves no pixels and is counted.
//!
//! THE DEVICE-INFO BLOCK ENDS. dev increments its cursor on every read burst
//! for as long as the host keeps clocking and answers zeros past the end of
//! the forty-byte block, so a driver draining too far is told it is still
//! reading device information. Here the block is twenty words and a read
//! past it is counted.
//!
//! A DATA WORD NEEDS A COMMAND IN FLIGHT. dev's data path falls through
//! every branch when no command has arrived, so a stray write preamble in
//! the middle of a transaction is swallowed in silence. Here it is counted,
//! which is how a framing slip shows up in the report at all.
//!
//! KEPT FROM DEV DELIBERATELY: the self-framing itself, the dummy word ahead
//! of every value, the 1530 mV power-on VCOM (a modelled controller value,
//! not any real panel's), and the pixels-per-
//! word decode, which is why a load at 4 bpp accounts four pixels to a word
//! and not two.
//!
//! THE PANEL IS ON SPI_B CHANNEL 0, where the epaper app's k_ep_spi_channel
//! puts it. The card is on SCI0 in Simple-SPI mode, not on SPI_B, so
//! nothing else shares the line and no chip select is needed.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: physical waveform transformations (a
//! refresh copies the requested area from the input buffer to the glass),
//! the image-buffer address, the panel's own busy timing (HRDY is driven
//! ready and stays there), and every register besides LUTAFSR, which are
//! shadowed and never interpreted.
