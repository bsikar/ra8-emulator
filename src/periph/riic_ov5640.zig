//! The OV5640 camera sensor's SCCB side, 7-bit address 0x3C.
//!
//! SCCB is I2C with a 16-bit big-endian register pointer and no auto-increment:
//! every transfer names its register. The chip-ID pair is what a driver reads
//! to decide the sensor is there at all, and the handful of output-format
//! registers are the ones firmware writes and then verifies.
//!
//! There is no analog sensor behind this. It answers the probe and remembers
//! configuration; it does not claim the board streams pixels.
