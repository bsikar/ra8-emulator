//! The Armv8-M Security Attribution Unit register window.
//!
//! This block exists because of ONE READ. The secure boot's SAU bring-up
//! opens with `SAU_TYPE & 0xFF` and programmes nothing at all unless the
//! count it finds there is bigger than the number of regions its boot map
//! needs. The PPB is mapped as ordinary RAM, so that read gave back zero,
//! the check failed, and ra8_tz_secure_boot_sau_init returned 0x107 without
//! writing a single region. Everything downstream of it in the secure boot
//! (the security init, the CPU1 release, the BLXNS into the Non-Secure
//! image) hangs off that return, so a run of cpu1_pingpong_ipc parked in the
//! Secure fallback main() forever and reported nothing about TrustZone at
//! all. TYPE is hardwired on silicon; nothing the firmware does would ever
//! have put the count there, so the model has to.
//!
//! RBAR/RLAR ARE BANKED THROUGH RNR, the same shape src/periph/mpu.zig
//! already carries for the MPU window beside this one. Five regions get
//! programmed as five RNR/RBAR/RLAR triples, and with the PPB as plain RAM
//! each triple would overwrite the last and the table would read back
//! holding only the fifth. The block keeps its own table, filed under the
//! region RNR names at the moment of the store.
//!
//! ATTRIBUTION IS NOT ENFORCED HERE and that is deliberate, said plainly so
//! a later slice does not mistake the gap for an oversight. This model runs
//! one flat, fully-accessible address space; it has no Secure and
//! Non-Secure worlds to place an access in. What the block does is answer
//! the capability read honestly and keep the map the firmware programmed, so
//! the report can say what the firmware asked for. Refusing accesses by it
//! is a separate piece of work and needs the world split first.
