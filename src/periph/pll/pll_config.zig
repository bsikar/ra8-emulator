//! One PLL's configuration pair, PLLmCCR and PLLmCCR2, and what a store does
//! to them once the bus has decided the access is allowed.
//!
//! Split out of src/periph/pll.zig when PLL2 arrived. That file owns the bus
//! side, the PRCR gate and MOSCWTCR; this one owns a single PLL's two words,
//! the counters for stores that went nowhere, and the two rules that decide
//! between them. Both PLLs get one of these, so the rules are written once.
//!
//! THE FIELD LAYOUT IS THE SAME FOR BOTH, which is the whole reason this file
//! is shared. ra8_cgc_regs.h says PLL2 "has the same field layout as PLL1
//! except the multiplier is 8 bits (vs 9)", and then defines
//! k_ra8_pll2ccr_mask_quarters as 0x7FF, the same eleven-bit (mul * 4) field
//! PLL1 uses. The mask is what ra8_cgc_usb.c actually writes through, so the
//! mask is what this follows: nothing here narrows the field on the strength
//! of the prose, because inventing a reserved bit would make a multiplier read
//! back wrong for no evidence at all.
//!
//! TWO RULES, BOTH FROM THE FIRMWARE'S OWN NOTES. The stop barrier is the
//! caller's to check, because only the bus side can see OSCSF; what lives here
//! is the decision that follows. The prohibited divider is entirely this
//! file's: the bit pattern 0000 in any of PLODIVP, PLODIVQ or PLODIVR is
//! "Setting prohibited" (HUM Ch 9.2.7 for PLL1, Ch 9.2.10/9.2.12 for PLL2),
//! and ra8_cgc_regs.h records the consequence in so many words: the entire
//! 16-bit register write is dropped and the register keeps its previous value.
//! So CCR2 takes the whole word or none of it.
