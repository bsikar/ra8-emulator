//! The low-power control registers the reset path restores: SBYCR, DPSBYCR
//! and LPSCR, all three write-protected behind PRCR.PRC1.
//!
//! These three were the next most-written addresses in the EIL corpus that
//! nothing modelled: 32 of the 36 images write all three, always the same
//! values in the same order. They come from ra8_lpm_safe_boot() in
//! ra8_lpm_safe_boot.h, an always-inline helper the reset handler runs before
//! .data and .bss are up. It unlocks PRC1 with 0xA502, writes LPSCR = 0,
//! SBYCR = 0x40, DPSBYCR = 0x14, then relocks with 0xA500. The point of it is
//! stated in the header: with LPMD left at whatever a warm reset left behind,
//! the next plain WFI can enter Software Standby instead of Sleep, so the
//! reset path puts the three registers back to their cold-reset values before
//! any driver runs.
//!
//!   SBYCR   (0x4001_E00C, 8b)  OPE bit 6, and nothing else software-writable
//!   DPSBYCR (0x4001_EA00, 8b)  IOKEEP bit 6, DCSSMODE bits 3:2, bit 4 reads 1
//!   LPSCR   (0x4001_EA90, 8b)  LPMD bits 3:0
//!
//! Offsets, widths, reset values and field positions are all from
//! libs/ra8_hal/inc/ra8_lpm_regs.h on zig/dev, which cites HUM Ch 11.2.18
//! p 456 (SBYCR), Ch 11.2.20 p 457 (LPSCR) and Ch 11.2.21 p 458 (DPSBYCR).
//!
//! The protection matters more than the bytes. ra8_lpm.c does NOT unlock PRCR
//! itself: its own header says "the driver assumes the caller has unlocked
//! PRC1 around protected writes" and exposes ra8_lpm_prcr_unlock/relock for
//! the caller to scope. A store that arrives with PRC1 clear is discarded by
//! silicon with no fault and no flag, exactly as PRCR's own header describes
//! for the CGC group. Modelling the registers without the gate would let
//! firmware that forgot the unlock configure a low-power state here and none
//! on the bench, which is the failure this model exists to catch.
//!
//! DELIBERATELY NOT MODELLED: entering any of these states. Nothing here
//! stops the core, gates a clock or powers a domain down; LPSCR records which
//! state a WFI would ask for, and the report says so. SSCR1 (0x4001_EA98) is
//! left out too: ra8_lpm_init writes it, but no image in the corpus calls
//! ra8_lpm_init, so there is nothing to check a model of it against.
