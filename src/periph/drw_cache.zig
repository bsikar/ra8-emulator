//! The DRW's two caches, both behind the one write-only CACHECTL register
//! (HUM Ch 62.2.4 p 3694): the framebuffer write-back cache and the texture
//! cache.
//!
//! This is the gap that mattered on dev. The HAL turns the framebuffer cache
//! ON before every stroked line and every triangle (ra8_drw_draw.c writes
//! CENABLEFX | CENABLETX | CFLUSHFX just ahead of the CONTROL/ORIGIN pair),
//! and board_periph_drw.c declines any render with CENABLEFX set, so every
//! line and every triangle the driver emitted came back to a blank
//! framebuffer and the app passed.
//!
//! WHAT IS MODELLED is where a rendered pixel IS. With the cache on, a
//! painted pixel is held here and is NOT in memory until a CFLUSHFX writes
//! it back, a read of that pixel is served from here rather than from the
//! stale word underneath (the blend path reads the destination before it
//! composites), and STATUS.CACHEDIRTY reports whether anything is held.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the line geometry. HUM Ch 62.2.4 names the
//! two enables and the two flush pulses and says nothing about line size,
//! ways or replacement policy, so this holds whole pixel writes in a bounded
//! table and writes the oldest one back when it runs out of room. The bound
//! is this model's, not silicon's. What it buys is the observable rule, that
//! a pixel is not in memory until a flush, not a cycle count.
