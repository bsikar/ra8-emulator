//! MIPI D-PHY: the physical layer under DSI and CSI, so its init sequence
//! can end.
//!
//! The block is one window at 0x4034_6C00 (ra8_glcdc_regs.h,
//! k_ra8_mipi_phy_base_addr, between MIPI DSI at 0x4034_6000 and MIPI CSI at
//! 0x4034_7000). Nothing modelled it, so every access fell through to the
//! sparse register file, and that had teeth: DPHYSFR is read-only status the
//! firmware never writes, so the sparse file handed back zero forever.
//! ra8_mipi_phy.c spins on it twice in one init, through
//! internal_mipi_phy_wait_set with a 4096-poll budget, once for PWRSF after
//! it powers the LDO and once for PLLSF after it clears PLLSTP. Both burned
//! their whole budget and returned a hardware timeout, so ra8_mipi_phy_init
//! reported "LDO did not stabilise" on a part that was working, and every
//! display and camera bring-up behind it stopped at that line.
//!
//!   DPHYREFCR  (+0x000)  reference clock, RFREQ[7:0] = MHz - 1
//!   DPHYPLFCR  (+0x004)  PLL frequency: IDIV, NFMUL, PMUL, NMUL
//!   DPHYPLOCR  (+0x008)  PLL operation, PLLSTP
//!   DPHYESCCR  (+0x00C)  escape clock divider
//!   DPHYPWRCR  (+0x010)  LDO supply, PWRSEN
//!   DPHYSFR    (+0x01C)  status flags, read-only, derived here
//!   DPHYOCR    (+0x020)  D-PHY enable, DPHYEN
//!   DPHYTIM1-6 (+0x024..+0x038)  lane timing
//!   DPHYMDC    (+0x048)  host (DSI) or device (CSI)
//!
//! DPHYSFR IS READ-ONLY AND DERIVED. A store to it is refused and counted,
//! the line ACMPHS draws around CMPMON and the RTC file draws around R64CNT.
//! What it reads comes from src/periph/mipi_phy_status.zig, which carries the
//! rule and states what it does not model.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the lanes themselves. Timing, escape clock
//! divider and reference frequency are stored, read back and never
//! interpreted, because nothing in this tree carries a lane-level model for
//! them to drive. The PHY's own interrupt is the same: ra8_mipi_phy_dispatch
//! edge-detects DPHYSFR in software off whatever vector called it, and no ELC
//! number for the PHY is in either tree, so nothing is raised here.
