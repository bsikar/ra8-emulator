//! What each byte of a ULPT channel belongs to.
//!
//! The channel window is not one width. ULPTCNT, ULPTCMA and ULPTCMB are
//! 32-bit and sit one after another, and then ULPTCR, ULPTMR1, ULPTMR2 and
//! ULPTMR3 are four single-byte registers SHARING THE WORD AT +0x0C. So an
//! access here can name part of one register (the high half of a 32-bit
//! reload) or several whole registers at once (a halfword store that starts
//! the channel and selects its count source), and the answer has to be
//! assembled a byte at a time.
//!
//! This file is only the map: which register owns a byte offset inside a
//! channel, and which byte of that register it is. The byte arithmetic is
//! `src/periph/bytelanes.zig`, and what each register MEANS stays in
//! `src/periph/ulpt.zig`.
