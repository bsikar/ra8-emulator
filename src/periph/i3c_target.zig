//! synthetic cycle is a controller write the firmware drains through the
//! data buffer, then a controller read the firmware answers with its echo,
//! paced by the firmware's own polling rather than by a clock here.
//!
//! dev counted a cycle whenever the firmware pushed a byte, whether or not
//! it had taken one first, and compared that byte against a stimulus the
//! firmware had never seen. A responder that never read anything came out of
//! the run with a clean echo record.
