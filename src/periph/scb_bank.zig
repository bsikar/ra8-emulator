//! Which System Control Block registers have a Secure and a Non-secure copy,
//! and where each copy lives in the emulator's plain-RAM PPB.
//!
//! The architecture says it register by register, in the "Attributes" line
//! of each D1.2 entry: banked between Security states, banked on a bit by
//! bit basis, or not banked. That is the whole table below, and nothing is
//! in it that was not read off a page of the Armv8-M ARM (DDI0553A.k):
//!
//!   banked          VTOR p1195, SHPR2 p1147, MMFAR p1085, CCSIDR p878,
//!                   CPACR p885
//!   bit by bit      ICSR p1025, AIRCR p862, SCR p1132, CCR p874,
//!                   SHPR1 p1145, SHPR3 p1148, SHCSR p1138, CFSR p880
//!   not banked      CPUID p890, HFSR p1021, DFSR p924, BFAR p869,
//!                   NSACR p1109
//!
//! The PPB is plain memory here, so a copy has to live at some address. The
//! Secure copy (and the only copy of an unbanked register) lives at the
//! register's own address; the Non-secure copy of a banked register lives
//! at its alias, 0x2_0000 higher. That is where firmware already writes it
//! from Secure state (VTOR_NS), so the choice keeps every existing image
//! reading what it wrote.
//!
//! A bit-by-bit register's banked bits are listed only once its page has
//! been read field by field. So far that is AIRCR (p862 to p865): PRIGROUP
//! [10:8] is the one banked field; VECTKEY/VECTKEYSTAT, ENDIANNESS, PRIS,
//! BFHFNMINS, SYSRESETREQS, SYSRESETREQ and VECTCLRACTIVE are not banked.
//! SCR (p1132 to p1133): SEVONPEND [4] and SLEEPONEXIT [1] are banked;
//! SLEEPDEEPS [3] and SLEEPDEEP [2] are not. CCR (p874 to p877): BP [18],
//! IC [17], DC [16], STKOFHFNMIGN [10], DIV_0_TRP [4], UNALIGN_TRP [3] and
//! USERSETMPEND [1] are banked; BFHFNMIGN [8] is not. Reserved bits are
//! left out of every mask.
//!
//! A bit-by-bit register is not given an address. Its shared bits have one
//! home and its banked bits two, so a whole-word answer would be wrong for
//! one half; the answer says so and the field split is left to the register
//! that owns it.
