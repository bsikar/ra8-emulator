//! One GPT channel: the counter, what it counts in, and the window it
//! answers on.
//!
//! The bank in src/periph/gpt.zig owns fourteen of these and routes an access
//! to one of them; everything below the routing is here. That split is the
//! house rule rather than a size exercise, but size is what forced it: gpt.zig
//! sat at exactly the 400-line gate ceiling, so the next slice touching the
//! most-used block in the corpus had nowhere to put a line.
//!
//! The channel is one thing with three faces and they are deliberately kept
//! together, because each is written in terms of the same fields. `tick`
//! advances the count in the shape GTCR.MD selects and raises what that
//! crossing raised. `readByte` and `writeByte` are the window: which of the
//! split halves owns the offset an access landed on, and the shadow for every
//! register this model does not interpret. And `quiet` is what the report asks
//! to decide whether this channel is worth a line.
//!
//! WHAT IS NOT HERE. The bank's own three action registers (GTSTR, GTSTP,
//! GTCLR) name channels by bit rather than by the window an access came
//! through, so they are dispatched a level up in gpt.zig and reach the channel
//! already resolved; `writeByte` ignores them for that reason. GTWP is
//! likewise taken whole at the bank, because the key is judged on the word a
//! store leaves behind rather than on a byte of it.
//!
//! The registers this file interprets directly are GTCNT, GTCR and GTST. Every
//! other one it understands belongs to a half of its own, and this file only
//! says which: gpt_compare.zig (GTCCRA/B), gpt_buffer.zig (GTBER and the two
//! compare buffers), gpt_period.zig (GTPR/GTPBR), gpt_lock.zig (GTWP),
//! gpt_mode.zig (GTCR.MD), gpt_clock.zig (GTCR.TPCS and CST) and
//! gpt_window.zig (the addressing itself).
