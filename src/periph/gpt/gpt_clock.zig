//! The GPT count source: how fast a channel counts, out of GTCR.
//!
//! GTCR (+0x2C) carries three fields (ra8_gpt.c `ra8_gpt_gtcr_bits_t`, which
//! cites HUM Ch 22.2.x "GTCR : General PWM Timer Control Register" p 904..906):
//! CST at bit 0, MD at bits 16..19, and TPCS at bits 23..26, the prescaler
//! that picks the clock the counter runs on. `ra8_gpt_prescaler_t` in
//! ra8_gpt.h names six encodings and no others:
//!
//!   0  PCLKD / 1       the undivided peripheral clock
//!   1  PCLKD / 4
//!   2  PCLKD / 16
//!   3  PCLKD / 64
//!   4  PCLKD / 256
//!   5  PCLKD / 1024
//!
//! GTCR was interpreted for CST alone here, so the whole prescaler field was
//! a value the register stored and nothing read. `ra8_gpt_init` writes it on
//! every channel it brings up, and `ra8_gpt_three_phase_init` writes the same
//! one to all three motor channels on purpose, so a channel a driver had
//! deliberately slowed to PCLKD/1024 overflowed exactly as often as an
//! undivided one and a period chosen against a divider was a thousand times
//! out. dev's board_periph_timer.c has the same hole.
//!
//! There is no absolute time in this model, so a divider cannot be a real
//! frequency. It is ORDERED instead, the way agt_clock.zig already treats
//! AGTMR1.TCK: the counts one chunk boundary stands for are scaled down by
//! the selected divider, so divide-by-1024 really is a thousand times slower
//! than undivided and a period that fits in one boundary at PCLKD takes many
//! at PCLKD/1024. That ordering is what an image comparing two channels can
//! see.
//!
//! A DIVIDED STEP STAYS ODD. gpt.zig picks an odd advance per boundary so it
//! is coprime to the 2^16 and 2^32 saw periods the drivers use; an even one
//! divides those periods evenly, GTCNT then visits a handful of values, and a
//! demo sampling on a power-of-two cadence reads the same count every time
//! and calls the timer wedged. Dividing an odd step by four makes it even
//! again, so the divided step is nudged back up to odd. The ordering between
//! dividers survives: 16385, 4097, 1025, 257, 65, 17.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the TPCS encodings neither the header nor
//! the driver names. TPCS is four bits wide and only six of its sixteen
//! values are named here, and on the part the rest reach the GTETRG event
//! inputs rather than a divided PCLKD. An unnamed encoding counts undivided
//! rather than being given an invented divisor, and `name()` says it is
//! unknown so the run does not claim to have recognised it. MD, the counter
//! mode, is still not modelled: every channel counts up in saw mode.
