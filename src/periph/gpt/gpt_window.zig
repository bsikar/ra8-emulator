//! Where a GPT channel's registers sit, and how a narrow store finds one.
//!
//! A channel window is 0x100 wide (ra8_gpt_regs.h `r_gpt_channel_regs_t`,
//! HUM Ch 22 register map p 879) and this model interprets eight of its
//! words; the rest it shadows. Two questions come up on every access and
//! neither belongs to the counting: which word a byte offset lands in, so a
//! byte or half-word store reaches the right register instead of falling
//! through to the shadow, and whether GTWP's protection covers that word.
//!
//! THOSE TWO QUESTIONS USED TO HAVE ONE ANSWER. `interpreted` served as the
//! protected set as well, on the reasoning that the registers this model
//! reads are the ones the HAL brackets between the GTWP keys. That is true
//! of every register but one, and the exception is the one a polling driver
//! leans on hardest: GTST.
//!
//! GTST IS NOT PROTECTED. Neither tree carries HUM's table of protected
//! registers, so the HAL's own bracketing is the evidence available, and it
//! is unambiguous. Across ra8_gpt.c's twenty-two bracketed windows, fifteen
//! registers are only ever written between `k_ra8_gtwp_key_unlock` and
//! `k_ra8_gtwp_key_lock`: GTCCR, GTCNT, GTCR, GTDNSR, GTDTCR, GTDVD, GTDVU,
//! GTICASR, GTICBSR, GTIOR, GTPBR, GTPR, GTSTP, GTSTR and GTUPSR. Exactly
//! one register is written with no bracket anywhere in the file, at both of
//! its two sites: GTST, in `ra8_gpt_clear_status` (line 425) and in
//! `internal_dispatch` (line 891), the ISR path that acknowledges the flag
//! it was entered for. A driver that has to unlock before acknowledging an
//! interrupt would be a strange thing to ship, and this one does not.
//!
//! The confirmation is that the firmware runs. gpt_one_shot_demo sits in
//! examples/ek_ra8d2/hw_validated/hil/, the tree's hardware-validated set,
//! and its inner loop is `ra8_gpt_get_status` until GTST.TCFPO shows, then
//! `ra8_gpt_clear_status` to drop it, with its hil.conf asserting the
//! counter advances at least ten times and the mismatch counter stays at
//! zero. `ra8_gpt_start_free_run` locks the channel on its way out, so every
//! one of those clears arrives with GTWP shut. If the part refused them the
//! flag would stand, and the app passed on the bench.
