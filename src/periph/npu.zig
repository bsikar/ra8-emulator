//! The Ethos-U55 micro-NPU: the command register, the stream it points at,
//! and what actually reaches the arenas.
//!
//! The RA8P1 carries an Arm Ethos-U55 behind a 4 KiB window at 0x4014_0000;
//! the RA8D2 does not, so this block is attached only on the RA8P1 profile
//! and on the RA8D2 the window falls through to the sparse bus, exactly as
//! the device tag on dev arranges.
//!
//! What runs is not Vela. The driver's submit, run, poll, read-output
//! protocol is real, and the program behind QBASE is the documented stand-in
//! in npu_cmd.zig, so an image can prove the whole path end to end without
//! this model pretending to do inference. Ported from board_periph_npu.c on
//! dev, with five things that model does not do.
//!
//! AN UNKNOWN OPCODE IS NOT A COPY. dev checks the marker, masks the opcode
//! out of the first word, and then runs anything that is not add-constant
//! down the copy path. So a stream carrying opcode 7 moves its bytes, sets
//! cmd_end, raises the interrupt and lands in the report as a completed job
//! named "unknown". That is the one thing the C file's own header promises
//! it will not do. Here an opcode outside the two implemented ones is a
//! parse fault: nothing moves, and it is counted.
//!
//! A FAULT RAISES THE INTERRUPT. dev sets STATUS.irq_raised on a fault and
//! then returns without raising the event, so the status register says an
//! interrupt was raised and no interrupt ever arrives. A driver that submits
//! a bad stream and waits on the NPU line waits for the rest of the run.
//! Here a fault raises the same event a completion does, because on silicon
//! the interrupt is that status bit.
//!
//! THE COMMAND BIT IS SPENT. dev stores the CMD write into its shadow before
//! acting on it, so NPU_CMD reads back with the run bit still set. The
//! driver's own acknowledge, read CMD, set clear_irq, write it back, then
//! kicks the job a second time from the bit it just read. Here CMD is a
//! command register: it is acted on and never kept, and reads back zero.
//!
//! ID AND STATUS ARE THE CONTROLLER'S. dev takes stores anywhere in the
//! window, NPU_ID and NPU_STATUS included, into the shadow its read path
//! then ignores, so the store is swallowed without a word. Refused and
//! counted here, the way this tree already treats CETCR, SRAMESR and INTS.
//!
//! NARROW ACCESSES KEEP THEIR SHAPE. dev's reg[off / 4] = value makes a
//! halfword store to QBASE's low half wipe the high half of the address, and
//! its read hands back the whole word whatever the access width was.
//!
//! MODEL RULES, stated rather than implied: execution is instantaneous, so
//! STATUS.state never reads running and STATUS.reset never reads asserted;
//! and a guest address is 32 bits here, so a BASEPn with anything in its
//! high word is refused rather than truncated into a plausible pointer.
