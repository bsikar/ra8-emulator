//! MRMS: the code-MRAM frequency latches and the prefetch buffer in front
//! of them.
//!
//! Three 32-bit registers at the R_MRMS base (ra8_mrms_regs.h,
//! k_ra8_mrms_base_addr 0x4013_C000, HUM Ch 59.5 p 3551):
//!
//!   MRCPFB  (+0x000)  prefetch buffer enable, bit 0
//!   MRCFREQ (+0x004)  MRICLK frequency in MHz, key 0x1E in the top byte
//!   MREFREQ (+0x008)  MRPCLK frequency in MHz, key 0xE1 in the top byte
//!
//! THE TWO FREQUENCY REGISTERS ARE KEYED LATCHES, NOT WORDS. The key byte is
//! part of the WRITE and not part of the register: ra8_mrms_regs.h's
//! ra8_mrms_key_t says a write whose key byte is anything else is "silently
//! dropped (the register continues to read back its previous value)", and
//! the driver's own wait loop depends on the accepted value coming back
//! WITHOUT the key. internal_wait_mrm_freq in ra8_cgc.c is the whole
//! contract in six lines: it compares `*reg == freq_mhz`, and only if that
//! fails does it store `key | freq_mhz` and go round again, up to
//! k_ra8_cgc_mrm_spin_limit (0x40000) times before returning
//! k_ra8_err_hw_timeout. The host build cannot run that loop at all and says
//! so: its seam comment reads "plain host RAM cannot strip the key byte on
//! readback the way the silicon latch does".
//!
//! THE GAP THIS CLOSES, and it was in front of every other one. Nothing
//! modelled these three, so they fell to the sparse register file, which
//! answers a written address with the word that was written. MRCFREQ
//! therefore read back 0x1E0000FA rather than 250, the comparison could
//! never be true, and the loop spent all 0x40000 iterations before returning
//! a hardware timeout. That timeout is step 6 of ra8_cgc_init's protected
//! core, so ra8_cgc_init failed on EVERY RA8D2 image, and every app whose
//! first act is `if (ra8_cgc_init() != k_ra8_ok) panic_halt()` parked in its
//! halt loop before it touched a peripheral of its own. The counter the
//! emulator-in-the-loop suite watches never moved, and the run reported
//! nothing worse than a budget spent.
//!
//! Now the key gates the store and is not kept: a write carrying the right
//! key latches the low 24 bits and a write carrying any other key is dropped
//! and counted, so the driver's first re-store satisfies its own comparison
//! on the next read. MRCPFB has no key and is an ordinary retained word; the
//! three dummy reads the driver does after clearing it are reads like any
//! other.
//!
//! THE TWO ORDERING RULES AROUND THE PREFETCH BUFFER, and they are rules
//! about WHEN, not about what a register holds. HUM Ch 59.4.3 "Frequency
//! Change Procedure" (p 3548) and FSP bsp_clocks.c both want the buffer
//! DOWN before any frequency change, and ra8_cgc.c's step 1 does exactly
//! that: internal_clear_pfb writes MRCPFB = 0 and then three dummy reads to
//! drain the pipeline, before a single divider or source moves. Step 10,
//! internal_set_pfb, brings it back up only above a floor: it reads MRCFREQ
//! back and writes MRCPFB = 1 only when that readback is at least 100 MHz
//! (k_ra8_mrcpfb_threshold_mhz, FSP's BSP_PRV_MRCPFB_LIMIT).
//!
//! NEITHER RULE IS REFUSED HERE, and the reason is the manual: it says what
//! the driver must do and does not say what the part does to a driver that
//! does not. A buffer left up across a frequency change is holding code
//! fetched at the old wait states, and a buffer enabled under 100 MHz is
//! running ahead of what the MRAM can serve; both are real faults on
//! silicon and neither has a defined register-level answer to model. So the
//! store lands, and the run counts it and says so, the same cut the DOTF
//! reversed pair, the OCTACLK early release, the AGT cascade start order,
//! SYRSTMSK and the ICU pin rewrite all take.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: nothing downstream reads these. No wait
//! state is inserted, no MRAM access is slowed, and the prefetch buffer
//! buffers nothing, because this model has no memory timing for any of that
//! to show up in. What the registers carry is reported and nothing more. The
//! 0x4013_C000 page's wait-state and ECC registers above +0x008 are not
//! claimed here either: this window is the three the driver names.
