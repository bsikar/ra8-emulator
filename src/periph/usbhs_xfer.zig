//! The transfer half of the host controller: a SETUP launched, a data stage
//! staged through the CFIFO, and a status stage completed.
//!
//! dev drove this from the register handler itself, bridging each step into a
//! second emulated part and raising BRDY and BEMP as soon as it had made the
//! call, so the polled host ran ahead of a device that had not answered yet.
//! Here the control transfer is a value with a state, the flags follow the
//! device, and a step the transfer is not in is refused.
//!
//! A SUREQ LAUNCH LATCHES EXACTLY ONE OUTCOME, SACK OR SIGN, and that is the
//! only thing the polled host can see. ra8_usb_host_ctrl.c's
//! internal_host_setup_wait W0C-clears both latches, asserts SUREQ, and then
//! spins on them: SACK returns ok, SIGN returns hw_error, and falling out of
//! the loop returns hw_timeout. Its own comment is blunt about why it cannot
//! watch SUREQ instead: "SUREQ self-clearing alone is NOT an ACK indication,
//! so gate on these." The loop is bound by k_ra8_usb_ctrl_poll_limit, which
//! is two million iterations.
//!
//! So a launch that latched nothing cost the driver that whole spin and then
//! reported a timeout, which is the wrong diagnosis twice over: it names the
//! clock rather than the bus, and it is the one outcome the HAL cannot tell
//! apart from a wedged controller. Both legs latch now:
//!
//!   SIGN when there was nothing on the bus to answer. That is what SIGN
//!   means on this part, per ra8_usb_regs.h: "SETUP transaction failed
//!   (3x)", three transmission attempts with no handshake back.
//!
//!   SACK the moment the token reaches something attached, BEFORE the
//!   request itself is judged. A SETUP token is ACKed at the token level by
//!   anything on the bus; a device that will not honour the request says so
//!   afterwards, in the stages that follow. So a refused request latches
//!   SACK too, and is counted as a stall on top.
//!
//! A REFUSED REQUEST PARKS THE DCP AT PID=STALL, which is how the refusal
//! reaches the driver at all. ra8_usb_host_ctrl.c's internal_host_dcp_in_wait
//! spins on BRDYSTS for the reply and checks DCPCTR against
//! k_ra8_usb_pid_stall_bit (0x0002, "PID[1]: set for either STALL") on every
//! turn of the loop, returning hw_error the moment it is up. Without it the
//! SACK from the token says go on, the reply never comes, and the driver
//! spends k_ra8_usb_ctrl_poll_limit before calling it a timeout. The bit is
//! the difference between "this device will not do that" and "this
//! controller is wedged", and only the first is true.
//!
//! The host clears it the way it clears any PID field, by storing a new PID
//! into DCPCTR: priv_dcp_pid(reg, k_ra8_pid_buf) re-arms the pipe. So the
//! stall survives reads and is dropped by the next write that names a
//! different PID, and a fresh SUREQ starts from whatever the host left.
//!
//! NOT MODELLED, AND NOT GUESSED: the bulk pipes' own STALL. Its reader
//! exists (internal_host_wait_pipe reads PIPECTR against the same bit) and
//! its own comment says the C host fake cannot raise it either, so nothing
//! in the tree says what stalls a bulk pipe here. Own slice, if an image
//! ever needs it.
//!
//! INTSTS0 IS THE DISPATCH MASK, not a spare shadow word. This model raised
//! BRDYSTS and BEMPSTS and left INTSTS0 reading back as a bare shadow word,
//! which is zero, so a driver dispatching on the mask saw an idle controller
//! on every turn no matter how many pipes had answers standing. BRDY and BEMP
//! now latch alongside their per-pipe bit; usbhs_int.zig holds the latch and
//! says what the rest of the register is and is not.
