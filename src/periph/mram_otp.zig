//! The extra-MRAM option-setting cells: what a Program command is allowed to
//! target, and what it is allowed to do to a cell that was already written.
//!
//! HUM Ch 5 Figure 5.2 p 237 labels this region "Extra MRAM
//! (option-setting memory)". It is not a data flash and the RA8D2 has no
//! user EEPROM: HUM Ch 59.7.4.5 Table 59.15 p 3592 enumerates every address
//! the Program command accepts and they all lie between 0x02E0_7600 and
//! 0x02E1_79F0, holding the FSBL setting, the measurement report and code
//! certificate addresses, general-purpose OTP, PBPS, POFSPS, REVOKE, the
//! HUK-zeroize enable and the anti-rollback counter.
//!
//! One-time programmable is the part dev leaves out. Its own header says
//! so: "a real OTP cell cannot be erased and re-programmed, so an emulator
//! pass for an erase/rewrite demo is optimistic". dev programs through to
//! guest RAM, so a rewrite demo passes there every time. Here a cell only
//! ever loses bits, the way the silicon does, and a command asking for a
//! bit back is refused rather than quietly doing less than it asked.
//!
//! The store is sparse: a run programs a word or two of option memory and
//! leaves the rest alone, so only what was written is held. A cell nobody
//! has programmed reads as erased.
