//! What runs alongside the core for the length of one run.
//!
//! A run is not just a core and a budget. Modelled time has to be charged,
//! a controller has to get its turn at each boundary, the board's blocks
//! have to tick, and a handful of watches (a counter, a breakpoint, a
//! deadline) have to be given the chance to end it. All of that is optional
//! and none of it belongs to the core, so it is gathered here and handed to
//! `Engine.run` as one value rather than a growing argument list.
//!
//! Everything is off by default: a bare `.{}` is one uninterrupted stretch
//! of execution with no modelled time and no exceptions, which is what the
//! loader and the smaller tests want. Every field is a pointer rather than
//! a copy, so the caller still owns the thing and can ask it afterwards
//! what happened during the run.
