//! Which firmware stores wipe a PendSV pend that was still standing.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. src/periph/standing.zig counts the chunk boundaries that
//! find `ICSR.PENDSVSET` up. On `wdt_supervisor_demo` over 200 modelled ms it
//! reads 18 boundaries against 376 stores that landed on a bit already
//! standing, longest unbroken run two. So the bit is not sitting up being
//! declined by the controller: it is GONE by the time the loop looks, and the
//! question is who takes it down.
//!
//! Three writers can. The controller clears it on entry, which is the
//! architecture and is counted as an entry already. The model's own
//! read-modify-writes of the register (the SysTick pend in
//! src/periph/clocks.zig, `clearPending` in src/periph/nvic.zig) go through
//! the engine and so cannot be seen from a Unicorn hook at all. And the
//! FIRMWARE can, because against a plain-RAM PPB a store of a whole word is
//! just a store: on silicon `PENDSVSET` is write-one-to-set and a zero in
//! that lane does nothing, while here it overwrites the bit.
//!
//! That last one is invisible today and is the only one a hook can settle, so
//! this counts it. A zero here says the losses are the model's own writes and
//! the next place to look is the engine side; a number near the 368 missing
//! says the write-one-to-set lane is the hole.
