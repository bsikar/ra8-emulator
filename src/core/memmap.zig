//! The emulated RA8D2 address space.
//!
//! The regions are silicon facts, so they are
//! constants here, not options.
//!
//! THE NON-SECURE ALIAS IS PART OF THE MAP, not a detail of TrustZone. The
//! IDAU on this part splits the space by address bit 28: the Secure view of a
//! region and the Non-secure view of the same bytes sit 0x1000_0000 apart, so
//! a permanent-Non-secure master reaches SRAM at 0x3200_0000 rather than at
//! 0x2200_0000. The firmware states that bit three times over. The peripheral
//! window's pair is already named in src/periph/registry.zig
//! (`ns_offset`, 0x4000_0000 and 0x5000_0000), and `cpu1_pingpong_ipc`'s own
//! CPU1 image names both of the other two: `k_cpu1_sau_periph_ns_base`
//! 0x5000_0000, and an SAU Non-secure SRAM window it then writes through at
//! 0x3210_0200.
//!
//! SDRAM's alias was mapped here from the start and SRAM's was not, which is
//! the gap this note exists to record. CPU1 in `cpu1_pingpong_ipc` is a
//! permanent-Non-secure controller, so every marker it writes goes through
//! the alias, and its first one (`k_cpu1_probe_reset_addr`, 0x3210_0200,
//! written at the top of the reset handler) landed nowhere: the run ended on
//! an unmapped store four instructions into the image, before the SAU was
//! programmed and before anything of the ping-pong ran. Both aliases are now
//! derived from one named offset rather than one of them being a literal and
//! the other missing.
//!
//! AN ALIAS IS THE SAME BYTES, and `alias_of` below is what says so. When the
//! alias was first mapped it was a region of its own with its own backing
//! store, so a marker written through 0x3210_0200 was not there at
//! 0x2210_0200 and cpu1_main.c's own description of the two views as "the
//! same backing store" was false here. src/core/board_ram.zig now puts both
//! views of a region over one host allocation, so the alias aliases.
//!
//! DTCM's alias is deliberately not mapped. The rule would place it at
//! 0x3000_0000, but the core's tightly coupled memory is reached over the
//! CPU's private port and nothing in the tree or the corpus asks for it
//! there, so mapping it would be following the arithmetic past the evidence.
