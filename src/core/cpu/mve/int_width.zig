//! MVE narrowing and widening moves and shifts from the Arm ARM (DDI0553)
//! pseudocode (RA8EMU-25). A narrowing op (VMOVN, VQMOVN, VQMOVUN, VSHRN,
//! VRSHRN, VQSHRN, VQRSHRN, VQSHRUN) reads each double-width lane of Qm,
//! shifts it right, optionally rounds and saturates, and writes it into the
//! bottom or top half of that lane in Qd, keeping the other half of Qd. A
//! widening op (VMOVL, VSHLL) reads the bottom or top half-lanes of Qm,
//! extends them, and shifts them left.
