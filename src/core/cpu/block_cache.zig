//! Formed blocks kept by start address (RA8EMU-405).

//! `next` hands `Cpu.step` the instruction at the PC with its decode, from
//! the block it is walking when the PC is the next entry, else from the
//! block that starts at the PC, formed on a miss. Every entry is checked
//! against the halfwords now in memory before it is handed out, so rewritten
//! code never runs stale. A write from anywhere over a marked code line also
//! drops the blocks on it (RA8EMU-407, RA8EMU-409). A null answer sends the step down its own fetch and decode,
//! which reports any fault or unknown encoding exactly as before.
