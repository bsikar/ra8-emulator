//! UpdateFPCCR's readiness bits (RA8EMU-621): at a lazy entry the core
//! records, for each fault the deferred push could raise, whether that
//! fault could be taken at the priority the interrupted code ran at
//! (DDI0553 UpdateFPCCR). A lazy push that faults later pends the fault
//! only when its bit says so.
//!
//! HFRDY: the execution priority was above -1. MMRDY, BFRDY, UFRDY and
//! SFRDY: the fault is enabled in SHCSR and its SHPR1 priority would
//! preempt, the same rule fault_route uses to decide escalation. MONRDY:
//! DEMCR.MON_EN is set and the DebugMonitor's SHPR3 priority would
//! preempt. SHCSR and SHPR1 are read as the running state sees them; their
//! Secure/Non-secure banking is the TrustZone lane's.
