//! A bounded poll's trips, counted once its values move by the same amount
//! every trip (RA8EMU-602).
//!
//! fixed_trip.zig retires a loop whose trip changes nothing. A counting poll
//! (internal_ns_ipc_recv counting up to 999999 while it reads a status
//! register) changes its counter every trip, so that test refuses it. The
//! recorder follows such a loop from its head: every instruction with the
//! registers before it, and the old value of every RAM word a store
//! changes. At each head it takes how far R0..R15 and those words moved.
//! Two trips that move them by the same amounts (three heads) hand the
//! second trip to counted_bound.zig, which says how many more trips take
//! the same path. `apply` then moves the registers and words on by that
//! many trips at once.
//!
//! The recorder only covers R0..R15, xPSR and RAM words. Everything else a
//! trip could change (FP state, banked registers, the exclusive monitor,
//! active exceptions) is the watch's to check, as for a fixed trip.
