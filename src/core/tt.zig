//! TT, TTT, TTA and TTAT: the answer the firmware's own SAU gives.
//!
//! The CPU model runs these instructions against its own SAU, which nothing
//! programs: the board keeps the SAU the firmware writes in
//! src/periph/sau.zig, and the PPB the registers live in is plain RAM to the
//! CPU model. So its TT said every address was Secure, and
//! cmse_check_address_range refused every Non-secure buffer a veneer was
//! handed. This file builds the response word from the board's map instead;
//! src/core/tt_hook.zig puts it in front of the CPU model.
//!
//! THE MPU HALF IS THE DISABLED-MPU ANSWER: MRVALID clear, R and RW set. The
//! CPU model's MPU is never programmed either (src/core/mpu_hook.zig keeps
//! the table the firmware writes), so that is what its TT gave too. Taking
//! R and RW from the board's MPU table is a later slice.
