//! The Secure to Non-Secure world switch: BLXNS, performed by hand.
//!
//! WHAT THE INSTRUCTION DOES. `BLXNS Rm` is Armv8-M's call into the
//! Non-Secure world: it branches to the address in Rm (bit 0 clear, which is
//! what marks the target as Non-Secure rather than Thumb), switches the core
//! to Non-Secure state, banks the stack pointer over to SP_NS, and leaves
//! FNC_RETURN in LR so the callee can come back. The RA8D2's secure boot
//! ends with exactly one of them, in `ra8_tz_secure_boot_jump_ns`, right
//! after it has written VTOR_NS and set MSP_NS from the Non-Secure vector
//! table.
//!
//! WHY IT IS NOT LEFT TO THE CPU MODEL. An Armv8.0-M CPU model does execute the
//! instruction: the branch lands, the stack banks, LR comes back 0xFEFFFFFF.
//! What it cannot do is make the target Non-Secure. Its M33 has an SAU of
//! its own, reached through the core rather than over the bus, and this
//! emulator maps the whole PPB as ordinary RAM, so every SAU register the
//! firmware programs lands in memory and the core's own SAU stays at its
//! reset state: disabled, which attributes the entire address space as
//! Secure. The core therefore arrives in Non-Secure state at an address it
//! considers Secure, and the very first instruction of the Non-Secure reset
//! handler raises a fault. On the firmware this emulator is built for, that
//! is `push {r7, lr}` at the Non-Secure reset handler and the run ends
//! there.
//!
//! WHAT IS MODELLED INSTEAD. This emulator has one flat, fully accessible
//! address space and no Secure and Non-Secure worlds to place an access in
//! (the same call src/periph/sau.zig records: the map is kept, attribution
//! is not enforced). In a single domain, entering the Non-Secure world *is*
//! a branch. So the site is hooked, the branch is performed here, and the
//! core never executes the BLXNS: it stays in Secure state, where every
//! address is reachable, and carries on into the Non-Secure image. Nothing
//! about the firmware's own sequence is skipped or patched.
//!
//! WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. Not a step towards real attribution:
//! there is no state to switch to, so a Non-Secure access that should fault
//! still will not. And no SG veneer handling: an image whose Non-Secure half
//! calls back into Secure through a Non-Secure-Callable entry needs the
//! range check those veneers make to pass in a flat space, which is its own
//! seam and not this one.
