//! Where in memory to look, as the command line spells it.
//!
//! `--dump-mem` takes a place rather than a bare address, because the thing
//! worth reading is rarely at an address known in advance. A filesystem
//! keeps the geometry it computes its sector numbers from inside a struct
//! it reached through a pointer: the struct's address changes run to run,
//! the offset into it does not. A place is therefore a base, an optional
//! single dereference, and an offset applied after it:
//!
//! ```
//! 0x22000058         the words at that address
//! g_eoh_err          the words at that global
//! @s_open+0x40       the words 0x40 past whatever s_open points at
//! ```
//!
//! Parsing is all this file does. Resolving a name to an address and
//! reading a word behind it need the image and the core, and belong to
//! whoever holds them.
