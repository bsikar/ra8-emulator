//! Which part a run models.
//!
//! The RA8P1 and the RA8D2 share a register map and a memory map, so one set
//! of peripheral models serves both and an RA8P1-linked ELF boots exactly as
//! an RA8D2 one does. The one difference is that the RA8P1 carries an Arm
//! Ethos-U55 micro-NPU and the RA8D2 does not, so the choice of part decides
//! whether the NPU window answers at all. Everything else on the board is
//! identical, which is why this is an enum; the memory geometry, cited per
//! part, is in src/core/part_map.zig.
