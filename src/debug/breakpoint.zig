//! The instruction address a run stops at, and which arrival to stop on.
//!
//! `--stop-sym` watches a counter in RAM, which answers "did the firmware
//! get as far as counting N of something". It cannot answer the question a
//! wall actually raises, which is whether a given function was entered at
//! all. Reading the C to decide that is guesswork, and on the SD provision
//! wall it has now been wrong twice.
//!
//! So this is the other half: an address execution stops at. The first
//! arrival is rarely the interesting one. A block read that fails does so
//! after a mount's worth of reads have already succeeded, so the question
//! is not "was the reader entered" but "what was different about the tenth
//! time", and only a count can ask that.
//!
//! The counting is done by src/interfaces/cli/zig_break.zig, which the Zig
//! core's run hands each retired instruction. An earlier cut handed the
//! address to the emulator as the point to run until, which stops on the
//! first arrival and cannot be resumed past: restarting a run AT the
//! address it is told to stop before either spins or steps over the very
//! instruction being counted.
//!
//! The interesting verdict is still the negative one. A run that ends
//! having arrived fewer times than asked reports how many it did see,
//! which is evidence a command trace cannot give: a function that issues
//! no bus access leaves no trace either way.
//!
//! Where to stop is named the same way `--dump-mem` names where to read,
//! so a break is not limited to a function's own first instruction. That
//! matters for a value a function RETURNS: the only place a return value
//! is still in r0 is the instruction after the call, which has no symbol
//! of its own and is reached as `caller+offset`.
