//! A place in memory whose stores are worth naming.
//!
//! `--break-at` answers "was this function reached"; `--dump-mem` answers
//! "what does it hold at the end". Neither answers the question a wall
//! actually raises, which is who put this value here. A run that ends with
//! `g_eoh_err = 5` says the firmware gave up and says nothing about where,
//! and finding out by hand means breaking on one candidate after another.
//!
//! A watched place records every store that lands in it, with the program
//! counter that made it. The recording knows nothing about the engine
//! that runs the code, so it can be tested without one.
