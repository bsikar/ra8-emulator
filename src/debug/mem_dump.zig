//! Read words out of the machine's memory at a place the command line named.
//!
//! `--dump-sym` answers "what is in this global", which is enough when the
//! thing worth reading is a global. It is not enough for the geometry a
//! filesystem computes its sector numbers from: that sits inside a struct
//! the firmware reached through a pointer, at an address that changes run
//! to run. A place (see `place.zig`) says how to get there, and this file
//! goes and reads it.
//!
//! Nothing that fails here is silent. A name the image does not carry, a
//! pointer that will not load, and a word that will not read each say so,
//! because a zero printed in their place would read like a real value and
//! this exists to settle exactly the questions a wrong value confuses.
