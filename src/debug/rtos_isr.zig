//! Exception entry and return for `--trace-rtos` (RA8EMU-224).
//!
//! The NVIC model counts every handler it enters (`taken`) and every return
//! (`returned`), and keeps the active exceptions as a stack. Both happen
//! between instructions, so reading those counters before each instruction
//! sees every one. A return that goes straight into another handler (a tail
//! chain) moves both counters at once; it is read as the return and then
//! the entry, which is the order they happened in. Two entries between the
//! same pair of instructions show as one, the innermost.
//!
//! This file reads the model's counters and nothing else, so the
//! watcher needs nothing from the core.
