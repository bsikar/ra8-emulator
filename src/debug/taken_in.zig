//! Every exception taken inside one named function, kept in full.
//!
//! src/debug/tally.zig counts (interrupted program counter, exception
//! number) pairs and displaces its weakest row when the table fills. That
//! is the right shape for finding where a run spends its interrupts, and
//! the wrong one for finding an interrupt that happened ONCE, because a
//! one-off is precisely the row a weakest-first policy throws away.
//!
//! The ThreadX freeze on `threadx_blink` is a one-off. Of 452 sleeps,
//! exactly one incremented `_tx_thread_preempt_disable` in
//! `_tx_thread_sleep` and never reached the decrement in
//! `_tx_thread_system_suspend`, and the thread stopped in between holds
//! the flag up, which stops the timer handler ever issuing a PendSV. The
//! tally could not show that entry and never could. This can: name the
//! function, keep every exception taken inside it, evict nothing.
//!
//! Bounded by keeping the FIRST entries rather than the most frequent. A
//! window that fires a handful of times a run fits whole; one that fires
//! constantly says how many it could not keep, and the answer to that is
//! a narrower window, not a longer list.
