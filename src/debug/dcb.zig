//! The debug control registers a firmware can see: DHCSR, DCRSR and DCRDR
//! at 0xE000_EDF0 (DDI0553, Debug Control Block).
//!
//! Firmware mostly reads DHCSR.C_DEBUGEN to learn whether a debugger is
//! attached, for instance before a BKPT in an assert handler. The debug
//! core is that debugger, so C_DEBUGEN reads one once it attaches, and a
//! firmware write cannot change it. With C_DEBUGEN set, a write carrying
//! DBGKEY may set C_HALT, which halts the core once the store retires, and
//! C_STEP and C_MASKINTS. With C_STEP kept, the next resume runs one
//! instruction and halts again. C_MASKINTS reads back, and src/periph/nvic.zig reads it to hold back
//! PendSV, SysTick and external interrupts (`masksInterrupts`)
//! yet. C_HALT is not
//! kept: the core only runs again after the debugger resumes it, and a
//! resume clears it. S_REGRDY always reads one because a transfer finishes
//! at once.
//!
//! DCRSR and DCRDR move a core register only while the core is in halting
//! debug state, which firmware never runs in, so a DCRSR write from
//! firmware is held but moves nothing. DCRDR is a plain data word, which
//! debug monitors use to pass values to the debugger. DCRSR is write-only
//! and reads zero. DEMCR at 0xE000_EDFC belongs to src/periph/clocks.zig;
//! this file only names the two monitor bits in it.
//!
//! DFSR at 0xE000_ED30 records why the core last took a debug event: a
//! halt, a breakpoint or a DWT trap. Its bits are sticky and a write of one
//! clears them.
