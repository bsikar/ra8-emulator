//! Every breakpoint a debugging session holds, in one table.
//!
//! `--break-sym` carried exactly one break, counted by its own hook. A
//! debugger needs as many as the person driving it sets, added and removed
//! while the run is stopped, and one place that answers "does anything stop
//! at this address". That place is this table. It knows nothing about the
//! engine: the stop machine asks it on each instruction, so it needs nothing
//! from the core.
//!
//! An entry is a `breakpoint.Break`, so the three kinds the epic asks for
//! (by address, by symbol, by symbol plus arrival count) are one kind here.
//! A symbol is resolved to its address before it reaches the table, and an
//! arrival count is the count the entry already carries.
