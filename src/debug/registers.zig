//! The core registers a run prints when asked, and how the line reads.
//!
//! `--break-sym` stops on a function's own first instruction, before its
//! prologue has moved anything. That is the one moment the argument
//! registers still hold the arguments, so the question a wall raises
//! ("which of these guards refused, and with what lba") is answerable by
//! reading them. After the prologue they are scratch and say nothing.
//!
//! The register set here is the caller-saved one the engine already
//! exposes, which is exactly the set AAPCS passes arguments in, plus the
//! three that say where execution is. r4 upward are callee-saved and are
//! not arguments, so their absence costs nothing at a call boundary.
//!
//! A 64-bit argument rides an even-odd register pair and pushes the rest
//! of the arguments onto the stack, so the words at the stack pointer are
//! printed too: without them a function like
//! `read_block(ctx, uint64_t lba, count, buf)` shows its lba and hides its
//! count.
