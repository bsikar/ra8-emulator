//! Per-image instruction budgets for the example table (RA8EMU-71).
//!
//! The table runs every image at one budget, the emulator's default unless
//! the caller names another. Most examples print their verdict long before
//! that. A few do real work first: ra8_io_swap_demo programs and reads back
//! the octal flash through a few thousand XSPI commands and only reaches its
//! "two-backend swap (ram + xs) PASS" line at around 12M instructions, so at
//! the default it reads "budget" with the swap still running. threadx_cpu1
//! waits on ten ThreadX ticks on CPU1, which CPU1's share of 2M never reaches.
//!
//! An override here is a floor, not a replacement: an image runs at the
//! larger of its own budget and the caller's, so asking the whole table for
//! more never gives a listed image less.
