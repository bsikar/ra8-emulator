# modules_corpus.sh -- run every ThreadX Modules image whose module manager

# against tools/modules_expected.md (RA8EMU-152). An image is a
# txm_*_m85.elf as ra8-firmware's `zig build arm` leaves it in zig-out/arm;
# the module manager images on CPU1 are pairs and live in

# Extra flags for `zig build` (a deps prefix, an optimize mode) come from

# a console line that changed, or an expected image missing from DIR.
# Update the expected file in the same PR as a change that means to move
