//! README verdicts for examples that ship no bench conf (RA8EMU-400).
//!
//! An image with no foo.hil.conf beside it has no HIL_EXPECT to judge its
//! console by, and its last line rarely says OK or PASS, so its row stays
//! unknown however well it ran. Where the example's README and main.c name
//! the line a good run prints, and the line a bad run prints, this table
//! carries both and the row is judged on its last console line.
//!
//! Only lines the firmware source prints verbatim go here. An image whose
//! README names no such line stays unknown until someone reads it.
//!
//! lin_commander_hil drives the LIN commander transmit path only: its README
//! says a real exchange needs a transceiver and a responder, so a sent frame
//! is the whole of what it can show. main.c prints "frame sent" after each
//! frame and "LIN TX error" when the driver refuses one.
