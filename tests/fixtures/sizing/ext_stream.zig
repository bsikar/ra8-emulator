//! External-memory sizing fixture (RA8EMU-755): streams a fixed amount of
//! data through the OSPI and SDRAM windows so `ra8_emulator sweep --elf`
//! has traffic to time across the memory matrix. Every word is read from
//! OSPI and written to SDRAM, then read back. A checksum and the marker
//! `0x5EE9C0DE` go to SRAM `0x22000100` when the run is done.
//! Built freestanding with Zig 0.14.1; see README.md for the command.
